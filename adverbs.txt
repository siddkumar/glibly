[Angrily]	BORKIN. Many thanks.  So you haven't the money! And yet the workmen must be paid, mustn't they?
[Calls]	IVANOFF. Don't you know it is bad for you to stand at the open window, Annie?  Shut the window, Uncle!
[Angrily]	BORKIN. No, seriously, shan't I marry Martha and halve the money with you? But no, why should I propose it? How can you understand?  You say to me: "Stop talking nonsense!" You are a good man and a clever one, but you haven't any red blood in your veins or any--well, enthusiasm. Why, if you wanted to, you and I could cut a dash together that would shame the devil himself. If you were a normal man instead of a morbid hypochondriac we would have a million in a year. For instance, if I had twenty-three hundred roubles now I could make twenty thousand in two weeks. You don't believe me? You think it is all nonsense? No, it isn't nonsense. Give me twenty-three hundred roubles and let me try. Ofsianoff is selling a strip of land across the river for that price. If we buy this, both banks will be ours, and we shall have the right to build a dam across the river. Isn't that so? We can say that we intend to build a mill, and when the people on the river below us hear that we mean to dam the river they will, of course, object violently and we shall say: If you don't want a dam here you will have to pay to get us away. Do you see the result? The factory would give us five thousand roubles, Korolkoff three thousand, the monastery five thousand more--
[Interrupting]	IVANOFF.  Oh, don't be coarse! [To LVOFF] It takes money to go to the Crimea, and even if I could afford it, you know she has refused to go.
[Sighing]	BORKIN.  The life of man is like a flower, blooming so gaily in a field. Then, along comes a goat, he eats it, and the flower is gone!
[Yawning]	SHABELSKI. Oh, nonsense, nonsense.  Everything is a fraud and a swindle. [A pause.]
[Thoughtfully]	IVANOFF.  It would cost a great deal for us both to go, and besides, I could not get leave to be away for so long. I have had one holiday already this year.
[Laughing]	SHABELSKI.  Upon my word, that man is no scoundrel, but a great thinker, a master-mind. He deserves a memorial. He is the essence of modern ingenuity, and combines in himself alone the genius of the lawyer, the doctor, and the financier. [He sits down on the lowest step of the terrace] And yet he has never finished a course of studies in any college; that is so surprising. What an ideal scoundrel he would have made if he had acquired a little culture and mastered the sciences! "You could make twenty thousand roubles in a week," he said. "You still hold the ace of trumps: it is your title."  He said I might get a rich girl to marry me for it! [ANNA opens the window and looks down] "Let me make a match between you and Martha," says he. Who is this Martha? It must be that Balabalkina--Babakalkina woman, the one that looks like a laundress.
[Laughing]	ANNA.  You can't even repeat the simplest saying without ill-nature. You are a most malicious old man. [Seriously] Seriously, Count you are extremely disagreeable, and very tiresome and painful to live with. You are always grumbling and growling, and everybody to you is a blackguard and a scoundrel. Tell me honestly, Count, have you ever spoken well of any one?
[Quietly]	ANNA.  Screaming again.
[Thoughtfully]	SHABELSKI.  First I would go to Moscow to hear the Gipsies play, and then--then I should fly to Paris and take an apartment and go to the Russian Church.
[Excitedly]	LVOFF.  Ivanoff, I have heard all you have to say and--and--I am going to speak frankly. You have shown me in your voice and manner, as well as in your words, the most heartless egotism and pitiless cruelty. Your nearest friend is dying simply because she is near you, her days are numbered, and you can feel such indifference that you go about giving advice and analysing your feelings. I cannot say all I should like to; I have not the gift of words, but--but I can at least say that you are deeply antipathetic to me.
[Listens]	IVANOFF. I suppose I am. As an onlooker, of course you see me more clearly than I see myself, and your judgment of me is probably right. No doubt I am terribly guilty.  I think I hear the carriage coming. I must get ready to go. [He goes toward the house and then stops] You dislike me, doctor, and you don't conceal it. Your sincerity does you credit. [He goes into the house.]
[Alone]	LVOFF.  What a confoundedly disagreeable character! I have let another opportunity slip without speaking to him as I meant to, but I simply cannot talk calmly to that man. The moment I open my mouth to speak I feel such a commotion and suffocation here [He puts his hand on his breast] that my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. Oh, I loathe that Tartuffe, that unmitigated rascal, with all my heart! There he is, preparing to go driving in spite of the entreaties of his unfortunate wife, who adores him and whose only happiness is his presence. She implores him to spend at least one evening with her, and he cannot even do that. Why, he might shoot himself in despair if he had to stay at home! Poor fellow, what he wants are new fields for his villainous schemes. Oh, I know why you go to Lebedieff's every evening, Ivanoff! I know.
[Tearfully]	SHABELSKI.  Nicholas, my dear boy, do please take me with you. I might possibly be amused a little by the sight of all the fools and scoundrels I should see there. You know I haven't been off this place since Easter.
[Exasperated]	IVANOFF.  Oh, very well! Come along then! How tiresome you all are!
[Excitedly]	IVANOFF.  Darling, sweetheart, my dear, unhappy one, I implore you to let me leave home in the evenings. I know it is cruel and unjust to ask this, but let me do you this injustice. It is such torture for me to stay. As soon as the sun goes down my soul is overwhelmed by the most horrible despair. Don't ask me why; I don't know; I swear I don't. This dreadful melancholy torments me here, it drives me to the Lebedieff's and there it grows worse than ever. I rush home; it still pursues me; and so I am tortured all through the night. It is breaking my heart.
[Laughing]	ANNA.  The flowers return with every spring, but lost happiness never returns. I wonder who taught me that? I think it was Nicholas himself. [Listens] The owl is hooting again.
[Sings]	ANNA. Nicholas can. I am beginning to be surprised, too, at the injustice of people. Why do they return hatred for love, and answer truth with lies? Can you tell me how much longer I shall be hated by my mother and father? They live fifty miles away, and yet I can feel their hatred day and night, even in my sleep. And how do you account for the sadness of Nicholas? He says that he only dislikes me in the evening, when the fit is on him. I understand that, and can tolerate it, but what if he should come to dislike me altogether? Of course that is impossible, and yet--no, no, I mustn't even imagine such a thing. 
[laughing]	ANNA.  That is what he used to say, long ago, oh, exactly! Only his eyes are larger than yours, and when he was excited they used to shine like coals--go on, go on!
[Laughing]	ANNA. You say that Nicholas is not what he should be, that his faults are so and so. How can you possibly understand him? How can you learn to know any one in six months? He is a wonderful man, Doctor, and I am sorry you could not have known him as he was two or three years ago. He is depressed and silent now, and broods all day without doing anything, but he was splendid then. I fell in love with him at first sight.  I gave one look and was caught like a mouse in a trap! So when he asked me to go with him I cut every tie that bound me to my old life as one snips the withered leaves from a plant. But things are different now. Now he goes to the Lebedieff's to amuse himself with other women, and I sit here in the garden and listen to the owls. [The WATCHMAN'S rattle is heard] Tell me, Doctor, have you any brothers and sisters?
[Gaily]	ZINAIDA.  My dearest Martha!
[Laughing]	FIRST GUEST.  Young people indeed! Do you call yourself an old person?
[Sighing]	MARTHA.  How can I make any pretense to youth now?
[Aside]	MARTHA.  Heavens! This is deadly! I shall die of ennui.
[Yawning]	LEBEDIEFF.  Oh, dear, our sins are heavy! [He catches sight of MARTHA] Why, there is my little sugar-plum! How is your most esteemed highness?
[Yelling]	AVDOTIA.  I said no-trumps, and not he!
[Furiously]	KOSICH.  I'll be damned if I ever sit down to another game of cards with that old cat!
[Excitedly]	MARTHA. How can you say it is not true, Sasha, when we all know it to be a fact? Why did he have to marry a Jewess? He must have had some reason for doing it. Are Russian girls so scarce? No, he made a mistake, poor fellow, a sad mistake.  And what on earth can he do with her now? Where could she go if he were to come home some day and say: "Your parents have deceived me; leave my house at once!" Her parents wouldn't take her back. She might find a place as a house-maid if she had ever learned to work, which she hasn't. He worries and worries her now, but the Count interferes. If it had not been for the Count, he would have worried her to death long ago.
[Laughter.]	AVDOTIA. They say he shuts her up in a cellar and stuffs her with garlic, and she eats and eats until her very soul reeks of it. 
[Horrified]	MARTHA.  Nine thousand!
[Hotly]	SASHA.  Mamma, you have already discussed this subject at least a thousand times!
[Laughing]	LEBEDIEFF.  That's right, Sasha! Give them a good scolding.
[Joyfully]	ZINAIDA.  My dear Count!
[Calls]	ZINAIDA. I am charmed to see you, Count. You are a rare visitor here now.  Gabriel, bring some tea! Please sit down.
[Whispers]	LEBEDIEFF. Dear friend, you cannot imagine how lonely I am without my old companions! I could hang myself!  Zuzu has frightened all the decent men away with her stingy ways, and now we have only this riff-raff, as you see: Tom, Dick, and Harry. However, drink your tea.
[Sighing]	ZINAIDA.  I know it seems as if no one could be richer than we, but where do they think the money comes from? It is all gossip.
[Gaily]	SHABELSKI. My dear little gold mine, do you call that a joke? It was a wail of the soul, a cry from the heart, that burst through my lips. My love for you and Zuzu is immense.  Oh, rapture! Oh, bliss! I cannot look at you two without a madly beating heart!
[Angrily]	SHABELSKI. He is a narrow-minded, conceited medico.  He shrieks like a parrot at every step: "Make way for honest endeavour!" and thinks himself another St. Francis. Everybody is a rascal who doesn't make as much noise as he does. As for his penetration, it is simply remarkable! If a peasant is well off and lives decently, he sees at once that he must be a thief and a scoundrel. If I wear a velvet coat and am dressed by my valet, I am a rascal and the valet is my slave. There is no place in this world for a man like him. I am actually afraid of him. Yes, indeed, he is likely, out of a sense of duty, to insult a man at any moment and to call him a knave.
[Laughing]	SHABELSKI.  The life of the company! The moment he comes in the air fe els livelier. Have you noticed it?
[Startled]	ZINAIDA.  Why, that is quite true! I never thought of it.
[Excitedly]	MARTHA.  Wait a minute; really, Misha, these things aren't done in a second like this. If the Count wants to marry me, let him ask me himself, and--and--I don't see, I don't understand--all this is so sudden----
[Angrily]	BORKIN.  How could I joke on such a serious subject?
[Laughing]	LEBEDIEFF.  His head is small, but the great ideas are hidden away in it like fish in the sea!
[Sighing]	LEBEDIEFF.  May one go and pay one's respects to her?
[Sighing]	LEBEDIEFF. She is a lovely, charming woman.  The day she fainted at our house, on Sasha's birthday, I saw that she had not much longer to live, poor thing. Let me see, why did she faint? When I ran up, she was lying on the floor, ashy white, with Nicholas on his knees beside her, and Sasha was standing by them in tears. Sasha and I went about almost crazy for a week after that.
[Angrily]	SHABELSKI.  Why does he tell such lies? Consumption! No hope! She is dying! It is nonsense, I can't abide him!
[Shrieks]	AVDOTIA.  Bad luck to you, you nearly knocked me down.
[Bows]	AVDOTIA.  How do you do, my son?
[Bitterly]	IVANOFF.  So you have turned my library into a bar-room again, have you? And yet I have begged you all a thousand times not to do so! [He goes up to the table] There, you see, you have spilt vodka all over my papers and scattered crumbs and cucumbers everywhere! It is disgusting!
[Startled]	LEBEDIEFF.  My dear boy, I didn't know that! I wasn't thinking of him at all.
[Shrieks]	LEBEDIEFF.  But she won't wait! [A pause.]
[Alone]	IVANOFF.  I am a worthless, miserable, useless man. Only a man equally miserable and suffering, as Paul is, could love or esteem me now. Good God! How I loathe myself! How bitterly I hate my voice, my hands, my thoughts, these clothes, each step I take! How ridiculous it is, how disgusting! Less than a year ago I was healthy and strong, full of pride and energy and enthusiasm. I worked with these hands here, and my words could move the dullest man to tears. I could weep with sorrow, and grow indignant at the sight of wrong. I could feel the glow of inspiration, and understand the beauty and romance of the silent nights which I used to watch through from evening until dawn, sitting at my worktable, and giving up my soul to dreams. I believed in a bright future then, and looked into it as trustfully as a child looks into its mother's eyes. And now, oh, it is terrible! I am tired and without hope; I spend my days and nights in idleness; I have no control over my feet or brain. My estate is ruined, my woods are falling under the blows of the axe. [He weeps] My neglected land looks up at me as reproachfully as an orphan. I expect nothing, am sorry for nothing; my whole soul trembles at the thought of each new day. And what can I think of my treatment of Sarah? I promised her love and happiness forever; I opened her eyes to the promise of a future such as she had never even dreamed of. She believed me, and though for five years I have seen her sinking under the weight of her sacrifices to me, and losing her strength in her struggles with her conscience, God knows she has never given me one angry look, or uttered one word of reproach. What is the result? That I don't love her! Why? Is it possible? Can it be true? I can't understand. She is suffering; her days are numbered; yet I fly like a contemptible coward from her white face, her sunken chest, her pleading eyes. Oh, I am ashamed, ashamed! [A pause] Sasha, a young girl, is sorry for me in my misery. She confesses to me that she loves me; me, almost an old man! Whereupon I lose my head, and exalted as if by music, I yell: "Hurrah for a new life and new happiness!" Next day I believe in this new life and happiness as little as I believe in my happiness at home. What is the matter with me? What is this pit I am wallowing in? What is the cause of this weakness? What does this nervousness come from? If my sick wife wounds my pride, if a servant makes a mistake, if my gun misses fire, I lose my temper and get violent and altogether unlike myself. I can't, I can't understand it; the easiest way out would be a bullet through the head!
[Angrily]	IVANOFF. It is clear that we shall never agree, so let me beg you to answer me now without any more preamble: exactly what do you want me to do?  What are you after anyway? And with whom have I the honour of speaking? With my lawyer, or with my wife's doctor?
[Startled]	IVANOFF.  Oh, Sasha, is that you?
[Laughing]	IVANOFF.  I have noticed that whenever you start reforming me and saving my soul, and teaching me how to be good, your face grows naive, oh so naive, and your eyes grow as wide as if you were looking at a comet. Wait a moment; your shoulder is covered with dust. [He brushes her shoulder] A naive man is nothing better than a fool, but you women contrive to be naive in such a way that in you it seems sweet, and gentle, and proper, and not as silly as it really is. What a strange way you have, though, of ignoring a man as long as he is well and happy, and fastening yourselves to him as soon as he begins to whine and go down-hill! Do you actually think it is worse to be the wife of a strong man than to nurse some whimpering invalid?
[Embarrassed]	SASHA.  How do you do?
[Sings]	BORKIN. What a beautiful apparition! I came expecting prose and found poetry instead. 
[Shuddering]	IVANOFF. What did I tell you?  Are you making fun of me?
[Angrily]	ANNA.  So that is the sort of man you are? Now I understand you, and can see how degraded, how dishonourable you are! Do you remember that you came to me once and lied to me about your love? I believed you, and left my mother, my father, and my faith to follow you. Yes, you lied to me of goodness and honour, of your noble aspirations and I believed every word----
[Laughing]	KOSICH.  The woman's head has been turned. Before she fixed her eye on a title she was like any other woman, but there is no coming near her now! [Angrily] A boor, indeed!
[Excitedly]	LVOFF.  Listen to me; tell me honestly, what do you think of Ivanoff?
[Frightened]	SASHA.  Oh! How can you say that?
[Embarrassed]	LEBEDIEFF.  My dear boy, I haven't a penny. All right though. That is to say, I can't promise anything, but you understand--very well, very well. [Aside] This is agony!
[Impatiently]	SHABELSKI.  Leave me alone! I can't abide you!
[Frightened]	MARTHA.  How? What?
[Imploringly]	SASHA.  Mother!
[Sternly]	SASHA.  What do you want?
[Coldly]	IVANOFF.  Many thanks!
[Laughing]	IVANOFF.  This is not a wedding, but a parliament! Bravo! Bravo!
[Shrieking]	SASHA.  I know what he wants to do! Nicholas, for God's sake!
[Shrieking]	SASHA.  Nicholas! For God's sake hold him!
[Thunder]	NAZAROVNA. God is sending a storm. The wind is wailing, and the rain is pouring down, pouring down. All down the roof and into the windows like dried peas. Do you hear? The windows of heaven are opened...  Holy, holy, holy...
[Pause.]	FEDYA. I can hear another of them. 
[Smokes]	FEDYA. Is it a good town?  Well-standing?
[Laughs]	FEDYA.  A gentleman’s cap! You’ve got to take it off in front of the mam’selles. How do you do, good-bye! How are you?
[Coughs]	BORTSOV. If you don’t like it, then let me owe you for the drink! I’ll bring in your five copecks on my way back from town. You can take it and choke yourself with it then! Choke yourself! I hope it sticks in your throat!  I hate you!
[Laughs]	FEDYA. It’s drumming in his head.... His stomach’s leading him on!  Your houour’s a happy man. Lie down and go to sleep! What’s the use of standing like a scarecrow in the middle of the inn! This isn’t an orchard!
[Angrily]	BORTSOV.  Shut up! Nobody spoke to you, you donkey.
[Pause]	FEDYA. Go on, go on! We’ve seen the like of you before! There’s a lot like you tramping the high road! As to being a donkey, you wait till I’ve given you a clout on the ear and you’ll howl worse than the wind. Donkey yourself! Fool!  Scum!
[Groans]	SAWA.  I’ve got shooting-pains in my leg, like bullets of fire.... Little mother, pilgrim.
[Thunder]	MERIK. I call myself after whatever passport God gives me. I’ve been Merik for two months.  Rrrr.... Go on thundering, I’m not afraid! [Looks round] Any police here?
[Loudly]	TIHON. What are you talking about, making mountains out of mole-hills?... The people here are all right... The police are fast asleep in their feather beds now....  Orthodox brothers, mind your pockets and your clothes, or you’ll have to regret it. The man’s a rascal! He’ll rob you!
[Blows]	MERIK. Like steam, like air.... Just blow into the air.  They’re like that, you can’t see them.
[Laughs]	MERIK. Aaa... greybeard! You skeleton!  You needn’t go to the churchyard to see ghosts, when they get up from under the floor to give advice to their relations.... A sin!... Don’t you teach people your silly notions! You’re an ignorant lot of people living in darkness.... [Lights his pipe] My father was peasant and used to be fond of teaching people. One night he stole a sack of apples from the village priest, and he brings them along and tells us, “Look, children, mind you don’t eat any apples before Easter, it’s a sin.” You’re like that.... You don’t know what a devil is, but you go calling people devils.... Take this crooked old woman, for instance. [Points to EFIMOVNA] She sees an enemy in me, but is her time, for some woman’s nonsense or other, she’s given her soul to the devil five times.
[Laughs]	TIHON. Eh, he’s let himself go I  Awful, isn’t it.
[Pause]	MERIK. Go on, do as you’re told! Quick now!  Do you hear me, or don’t you? Am I talking to you or the wall? [Stands up]
[Pause.]	FEDYA. A real lady.... Look at her cheeks, her eyes.... Open your hand, I can’t see. Hair coming down to her waist.... It is lifelike! She might be going to say something.... 
[Drinks.]	KUSMA. God gave us arms to wave about. Poor sugary things, you’re half-melted. You’re frightened of the rain, poor delicate things. 
[Drinks.]	KUSMA. Forgive me, your honour, I’m only telling them a little... what does it matter, anyway.... I’m shaking all over. Pour out some more. 
[Drinks]	KUSMA. I’ll tell you quietly.... He doesn’t want me to, but it can’t be helped.... But there’s nothing more to tell. They got married, that’s all. There was nothing else. Pour out another drop for Kusma the stony!  I don’t like people getting drunk! Why the time the wedding took place, when the gentlefolk sat down to supper afterwards, she went off in a carriage... [Whispers] To the town, to her lover, a lawyer.... Eh? What do you think of her now? Just at the very moment! She would be let off lightly if she were killed for it!
[Thoughtfully]	MERIK.  Well... what happened then?
[Pause]	MERIK. I’ve been alive thirty-five years and I haven’t robbed the post once....  It’s gone now... too late, too late....
[Suddenly]	MERIK. People rob and don’t go to prison. And if I do go!  What else?
[Sighs]	KUSMA. The second reason, brothers, why he was ruined was because of his brother-in-law, his sister’s husband.... He took it into his head to stand surety at the bank for 30,000 roubles for his brother-in-law. The brother-in-law’s a thief.... The swindler knows which side his bread’s buttered and won’t budge an inch.... So he doesn’t pay up.... So our man had to pay up the whole thirty thousand.  The fool is suffering for his folly. His wife’s got children now by the lawyer and the brother-in-law has bought an estate near Poltava, and our man goes round inns like a fool, and complains to the likes of us: “I’ve lost all faith, brothers! I can’t believe in anybody now!” It’s cowardly! Every man has his grief, a snake that sucks at his heart, and does that mean that he must drink? Take our village elder, for example. His wife plays about with the schoolmaster in broad daylight, and spends his money on drink, but the elder walks about smiling to himself. He’s just a little thinner...
[Sighs]	TIHON.  When God gives a man strength....
[Pays]	KUSMA. There’s all sorts of strength, that’s true.... Well? How much does it come to?  Take your pound of flesh! Good-bye, children! Good-night and pleasant dreams! It’s time I hurried off. I’m bringing my lady a midwife from the hospital.... She must be getting wet with waiting, poor thing.... [Runs out. A pause.]
[Drinks]	BORTSOV.  How dare he? The fool! [to MERIK] Do you understand? You’re a fool, a donkey!
[Laughs]	BORTSOV.  What a woman.... Why do you keep on going round? I can’t catch you!
[Laughs]	MERIK. He’s wandering. Looked too long at the portrait.  What a business! Educated people go and invent all sorts of machines and medicines, but there hasn’t yet been a man wise enough to invent a medicine against the female sex.... They try to cure every sort of disease, and it never occurs to them that more people die of women than of disease.... Sly, stingy, cruel, brainless.... The mother-in-law torments the bride and the bride makes things square by swindling the husband... and there’s no end to it....
[Pause]	MERIK. It isn’t only I.... From the beginning of the ages, since the world has been in existence, people have complained.... It’s not for nothing that in the songs and stories, the devil and the woman are put side by side.... Not for nothing! It’s half true, at any rate...  Here’s the gentleman playing the fool, but I had more sense, didn’t I, when I left my father and mother, and became a tramp?
[Pause]	MERIK. Never you mind....  Do you think I killed her?... I wouldn’t do it.... If you kill, you are sorry for it.... She can live and be happy! If only I’d never set eyes on you, or if I could only forget you, you viper’s brood! [A knocking at the door.]
[Knocking]	TIHON. Whom have the devils brought.... Who’s there?  Who knocks? [Gets up and goes to the door] Who knocks? Go away, we’ve locked up!
[Pause]	THE VOICE. Very well, wait a bit.  She says, all right.
[Yells]	BORTSOV. Her voice, her movements.... Marie, it is I! I’ll stop in a moment.... I was drunk.... My head’s going round.... My God! Stop, stop.... I can’t understand anything.  My wife! [Falls at her feet and sobs. A group collects around the husband and wife.]
[Aside]	CHUBUKOV.  He’s come to borrow money! Shan’t give him any! [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?
[Joyfully]	CHUBUKOV.  By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn’t hear it all!
[Interrupting]	CHUBUKOV.  My dear fellow... I’m so glad, and so on.... Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV] I’ve been hoping for it for a long time. It’s been my continual desire. [Sheds a tear] And I’ve always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I did so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I’m off my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul... I’ll go and call Natasha, and all that.
[Exit.]	CHUBUKOV. Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won’t consent! She’s in love; egad, she’s like a love-sick cat, and so on.... Shan’t be long! 
[Drinks]	LOMOV. It’s cold... I’m trembling all over, just as if I’d got an examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up. If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for an ideal, or for real love, then I’ll never get married.... Brr!... It’s cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking, well-educated.... What more do I want? But I’m getting a noise in my ears from excitement.  And it’s impossible for me not to marry.... In the first place, I’m already 35--a critical age, so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life.... I suffer from palpitations, I’m excitable and always getting awfully upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there’s a twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly something in my left side--gives a pull, and I can feel it in my shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there’s another pull! And this may happen twenty times....
[Excited]	LOMOV.  You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the fact is, I’ve made up my mind to ask you to hear me out.... Of course you’ll be surprised and perhaps even angry, but a... [Aside] It’s awfully cold!
[Pause]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA. What’s the matter?  Well?
[Yells]	LOMOV. If it wasn’t, madam, for this awful, excruciating palpitation, if my whole inside wasn’t upset, I’d talk to you in a different way!  Oxen Meadows are mine!
[Hysterics.]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Quick, quick! I’m ill! Fetch him! 
[Wails]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA.  Fetch him!
[Yells]	CHUBUKOV.  He’s coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to be the father of a grown-up daughter! I’ll cut my throat! I will, indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out, and it’s all you... you!
[Aside]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA. Yes, yes, let that pass....  I wish I knew how to get him started.... [Aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?
[Sighs]	LOMOV. I don’t know.... Must have got twisted, or bitten by some other dog....  My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.
[Laughs]	LOMOV. Squeezer better than. Guess? What an idea!  Squeezer better than Guess!
[Shouts]	LOMOV. Madam, please be silent.... My heart is going to pieces....  Shut up!
[Weeps]	LOMOV.  Shut up! My heart’s bursting!
[Teasing]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA.  My heart.... What sort of a hunter are you? You ought to go and lie on the kitchen oven and catch blackbeetles, not go after foxes! My heart!
[Shouts]	CHUBUKOV. What? I an intriguer?  Shut up!
[Wails]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA.  He’s dead... dead!
[Wails]	NATALYA STEPANOVNA.  He’s alive... Yes, yes, I’m willing....
[Sighs]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA. It’s Andrey Andreyevitch’s fault.... Yesterday he came to see us and promised to bring a perfectly real general.  I suppose he couldn’t find one anywhere, or he’d have brought him.... You think we don’t mind? We’d begrudge our child nothing. A general, of course...
[Shouting]	GROOMSMAN.  Promenade! Messieurs, promenade! [Behind] Promenade!
[Sings]	YATS. No, you’re simply heartless! To be so cruel--if I may express myself--and to have such a beautiful, beautiful voice! With such a voice, if you will forgive my using the word, you shouldn’t be a midwife, but sing at concerts, at public gatherings! For example, how divinely you do that _fioritura_... that...  “I loved you; love was vain then....” Exquisite!
[Sings]	ZMEYUKINA.  “I loved you, and may love again.” Is that it?
[Shouts]	ZHIGALOV. If it’s time, then it’s time. Ladies and gentlemen, please!  Supper! Young people!
[Aside]	YATS.  Wonderful woman! I’m in love! Up to my ears!
[Rising]	MOZGOVOY.  Ladies and gentlemen! I must tell you this.... We are going to have a great many toasts and speeches. Don’t let’s wait, but begin at once. Ladies and gentlemen, the newly married!
[Meditatively]	ZHIGALOV.  Electricity... h’m.... In my opinion electric lighting is just a swindle.... They put a live coal in and think you don’t see them! No, if you want a light, then you don’t take a coal, but something real, something special, that you can get hold of! You must have a fire, you understand, which is natural, not just an invention!
[Tearfully]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA. Don’t you go making hints. We respect you on account of your parents, and we’ve invited you to the wedding, and here you go talking. If you knew that Epaminond Maximovitch was marrying for profit, why didn’t you say so before?  I brought her up, I fed her, I nursed her.... I cared for her more than if she was an emerald jewel, my little girl....
[Shouts]	A GROOMSMAN.  The health of the bride’s parents, Evdokim Zaharitch and Nastasya Timofeyevna! [Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]
[Sighs]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.  One doesn’t like to spend money for nothing, Andrey darling!
[Shouts]	NUNIN.  Musicians! A march! [The band plays a march for a minute.]
[Bowing]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.  Please come in, your excellency! So glad you’ve come!
[Whispers]	NUNIN.  I know, only, Fyodor Yakovlevitch, be a good man and let us call you your excellency! The family here, you see, is patriarchal; it respects the aged, it likes rank.
[Taps.]	YATS. It means, “I honour you, your excellency, for your virtues.” You think it’s easy? Listen now. 
[Rising]	A GROOMSMAN.  Ladies and gentlemen...
[Interrupting]	REVUNOV.  Yes, you’ve got to remember all that! For instance, “Hoist the topsail halyards. Lower the topsail gallants!”
[Annoyed]	THE GROOMSMAN.  Why does he keep on interrupting? We shan’t get through a single speech like that!
[Exploding]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.  General, your manners.... You ought to be ashamed of yourself, at your age!
[Loudly]	NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.  I say you ought to be ashamed of yourself at your age! General, your manners are awful!
[Confused]	NUNIN.  Ladies and gentlemen, is it worth it? Really...
[Upset]	REVUNOV.  What money?
[Shouts]	NUNIN. Is it worth while bothering about such trifles? What does it matter! Everybody’s happy here, and here you go....  The health of the bride and bridegroom! A march! A march! [The band plays a march] The health of the bride and bridegroom!
[Sighs]	LUKA. Well, there you are! Nicolai Mihailovitch is dead, well, it’s the will of God, and may his soul rest in peace.... You’ve mourned him--and quite right. But you can’t go on weeping and wearing mourning for ever. My old woman died too, when her time came. Well? I grieved over her, I wept for a month, and that’s enough for her, but if I’ve got to weep for a whole age, well, the old woman isn’t worth it.  You’ve forgotten all your neighbours. You don’t go anywhere, and you see nobody. We live, so to speak, like spiders, and never see the light. The mice have eaten my livery. It isn’t as if there were no good people around, for the district’s full of them. There’s a regiment quartered at Riblov, and the officers are such beauties--you can never gaze your fill at them. And, every Friday, there’s a ball at the camp, and every day the soldier’s band plays.... Eh, my lady! You’re young and beautiful, with roses in your cheek--if you only took a little pleasure. Beauty won’t last long, you know. In ten years’ time you’ll want to be a pea-hen yourself among the officers, but they won’t look at you, it will be too late.
[Weeps.]	POPOVA. Oh! 
[Shaking]	POPOVA.  Who’s that? Tell them that I receive nobody.
[Exit.]	LUKA. Yes, madam. 
[Annoyed]	POPOVA.  Very well, ask him in.... What manners! [Exit LUKA] How these people annoy me! What does he want of me? Why should he disturb my peace? [Sighs] No, I see that I shall have to go into a convent after all. [Thoughtfully] Yes, into a convent.... [Enter LUKA with SMIRNOV.]
[Yells]	SMIRNOV. Well, there! “A state of mind.”... “Husband died seven months ago!” Must I pay the interest, or mustn’t I? I ask you: Must I pay, or must I not? Suppose your husband is dead, and you’ve got a state of mind, and nonsense of that sort.... And your steward’s gone away somewhere, devil take him, what do you want me to do? Do you think I can fly away from my creditors in a balloon, or what? Or do you expect me to go and run my head into a brick wall? I go to Grusdev and he isn’t at home, Yaroshevitch has hidden himself, I had a violent row with Kuritsin and nearly threw him out of the window, Mazugo has something the matter with his bowels, and this woman has “a state of mind.” Not one of the swine wants to pay me! Just because I’m too gentle with them, because I’m a rag, just weak wax in their hands! I’m much too gentle with them! Well, just you wait! You’ll find out what I’m like! I shan’t let you play about with me, confound it! I shall jolly well stay here until she pays! Brr!... How angry I am to-day, how angry I am! All my inside is quivering with anger, and I can’t even breathe.... Foo, my word, I even feel sick!  Waiter!
[Angrily]	SMIRNOV  What?
[Aside]	LUKA.  The devil’s come to stay.... Bad luck that brought him.... [Exit.]
[Yells]	SMIRNOV. Oh, how angry I am! So angry that I think I could grind the whole world to dust.... I even feel sick....  Waiter!
[Exploding]	POPOVA.  What? How dare you say all that to me?
[Sits]	SMIRNOV. I have not the pleasure of being either your husband or your fiancé, so please don’t make scenes.  I don’t like it.
[Aside]	SMIRNOV. Give me my money....  Oh, how angry I am! How angry I am!
[Pause]	POPOVA. I don’t want to talk to impudent scoundrels! Get out of this!  Aren’t you going? No?
[Shouts]	POPOVA. Where’s Dasha? Dasha!  Dasha! Pelageya! Dasha! [Rings.]
[Kneels]	LUKA. Gracious little fathers!...  Have pity on a poor old man, and go away from here! You’ve frightened her to death, and now you want to shoot her!
[Weeps]	LUKA.  Dear... dear sir, do go away!
[Exit.]	LUKA. Oh, Lord, have mercy and save her.... I’ll go and find the coachman and the gardener.... Why has this infliction come on us.... 
[Laughs]	POPOVA.  He likes me! He dares to say that he likes me! [Points to the door] That’s the way.
[Yells]	SMIRNOV. I’m mad.... I understand nothing.  Waiter, water!
[Yells]	POPOVA.  Let’s go out and fight!
[Stops]	SMIRNOV.  Well?
[Yells]	POPOVA. Yes, yes, go away!...  Where are you going? Stop.... No, go away. Oh, how angry I am! Don’t come near me, don’t come near me!
[Delighted]	MURASHKIN.  Really? Then you’ll know Olga Pavlovna Finberg, who lives there?
[Stamping]	TOLKACHOV.  Give me the sewing-machine! Where’s the bird-cage? Now get on top yourself! Eat me! Tear me to pieces! Kill me! [Clenching his fists] I want blood! Blood! Blood!
[Rudely]	KHIRIN.  As it’s an anniversary, Andrey Andreyevitch, I’ll ask for a special favour. Please, even if it’s only out of respect for my toil, don’t interfere in my family life. Please!
[Sighs]	SHIPUCHIN.  Yours is an impossible character, Kusma Nicolaievitch! You’re an excellent and respected man, but you behave to women like some scoundrel. Yes, really. I don’t understand why you hate them so?
[Pause.]	KHIRIN. I wish I could understand why you love them so! 
[Excitedly]	SHIPUCHIN.  But you will admit that it’s untidy! You spoil the _ensemble_!
[Panting]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.  Were you very dull without me? Are you well? I haven’t been home yet, I came here straight from the station. I’ve a lot, a lot to tell you.... I couldn’t wait.... I shan’t take off my clothes, I’ll only stay a minute. [To KHIRIN] Good morning, Kusma Nicolaievitch! [To her husband] Is everything all right at home?
[Confused]	SHIPUCHIN.  My dear, we don’t talk about these things. You’d really better go home.
[Laughs]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA. In a minute, in a minute. I’ll tell you everything in one minute and go. I’ll tell you from the very beginning. Well.... When you were seeing me off, you remember I was sitting next to that stout lady, and I began to read. I don’t like to talk in the train. I read for three stations and didn’t say a word to anyone.... Well, then the evening set in, and I felt so mournful, you know, with such sad thoughts! A young man was sitting opposite me--not a bad-looking fellow, a brunette.... Well, we fell into conversation.... A sailor came along then, then some student or other....  I told them that I wasn’t married... and they did look after me! We chattered till midnight, the brunette kept on telling the most awfully funny stories, and the sailor kept on singing. My chest began to ache from laughing. And when the sailor--oh, those sailors!--when he got to know my name was TATIANA, you know what he sang? [Sings in a bass voice] “Onegin don’t let me conceal it, I love Tatiana madly!” [Note: From the Opera _Evgeni Onegin_--words by Pushkin.] [Roars with laughter.]
[Angrily]	KHIRIN.  Excuse me, you’ve made me lose my place! You go talking about your mamma and Katya, and I understand nothing; and I’ve lost my place.
[Laughs.]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA. What does that matter? You listen when a lady is talking to you! Why are you so angry to-day? Are you in love? 
[Irritated]	SHIPUCHIN.  That’s all right; I quite believe you, but it’s not our business. [Behind the scene, TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA’S laughter is heard, then a man’s. SHIPUCHIN glances at the door] She’s disturbing the employees. [To MERCHUTKINA] It’s strange and it’s even silly. Surely your husband knows where you ought to apply?
[Sighs]	SHIPUCHIN.  Ouf!
[Surprised]	MERCHUTKINA.  And where’s the money?
[Offended]	MERCHUTKINA.  What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can do that to your own wife, but I’m the wife of a civil servant.... You can’t do that to me!
[Stamping.]	KHIRIN. If you don’t get out this second, I’ll call for the hall-porter! Get out! 
[Dully]	SHIPUCHIN.  What else? What do you want?
[Aside]	SHIPUCHIN. All right, madam, I’ll see to it... and take the necessary steps.... Go away now... later on!  My gout’s coming on!
[Frightened]	SHIPUCHIN.  No, no! She’ll kick up a row and we aren’t the only people in the building.
[Panting]	SHIPUCHIN.  Ouf!
[Exhausted]	SHIPUCHIN.  How much do you want?
[Sighs]	SHIPUCHIN.  Ouf!
[Weeps]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.  We ran to the summer-house, and there... there poor Grendilevsky was lying... with a pistol in his hand....
[Weeping]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.  He’d shot himself right in the heart... here.... And the poor man had fallen down senseless.... And he was awfully frightened, as he lay there... and asked for a doctor. A doctor came soon... and saved the unhappy man....
[Weeps]	SHIPUCHIN. No, I can’t stand this!  I can’t stand it! [Stretches out both his hands in despair to KHIRIN] Drive her away! Drive her away, I implore you!
[Points]	SHIPUCHIN. Not her, but this one... this awful woman....  That one!
[Shouts]	SHIPUCHIN.  Stop! I ask you! I implore you!
[Screams]	MERCHUTKINA. Little fathers... little fathers!  Little fathers!...
[Shouts]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.  Help! Help!... Oh, oh... I’m sick, I’m sick! [Jumps on to a chair, then falls on to the sofa and groans as if in a faint.]
[Stamps]	KHIRIN.  Get out of it, devil take me! [Turns up his sleeves] Give her to me: I may break the law!
[Groans]	MERCHUTKINA.  Oh! Oh!
[Groans]	TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA.  Water! Water!
[Continues]	THE MEMBER OF THE DEPUTATION.  The reputation [Coughs]... the reputation of the bank has been raised by you to such a height that we are now the rivals of the best foreign concerns.
[Pause]	OLGA. Don’t whistle, Masha. How can you!  I’m always having headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and gains in strength...
[Pause]	OLGA. You’re all radiance to-day, I’ve never seen you look so lovely. And Masha is pretty, too. Andrey wouldn’t be bad-looking, if he wasn’t so stout; it does spoil his appearance. But I’ve grown old and very thin, I suppose it’s because I get angry with the girls at school. To-day I’m free. I’m at home. I haven’t got a headache, and I feel younger than I was yesterday. I’m only twenty-eight.... All’s well, God is everywhere, but it seems to me that if only I were married and could stay at home all day, it would be even better.  I should love my husband.
[Tenderly]	CHEBUTIKIN.  I’ll refuse, I’ll refuse....
[Laughs.]	OLGA. Father used to make us get up at seven. Now Irina wakes at seven and lies and meditates about something till nine at least. And she looks so serious! 
[Laughs]	CHEBUTIKIN.  It’s quite true, I never have worked. After I came down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket] Here we are.... I’ve learnt from the papers that there used to be one, Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of Russia], for instance, but what he wrote--I don’t know... God only knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There.... They’re calling me downstairs, somebody’s come to see me. I’ll be back in a minute... won’t be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]
[Displeased]	IRINA.  You are queer....
[Crying]	OLGA.  I understand you, Masha.
[Pause.]	SOLENI. Oh, nothing. You came down on me before I could say... help! 
[Louder]	IRINA.  Please thank him.
[Exeunt.]	ANFISA. Come on, gran’fer, Ferapont Spiridonitch. Come on. 
[Laughs]	TUZENBACH.  I told you so!
[Gaily]	VERSHININ.  I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters, surely. I remember--three little girls. I forget your faces, but your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly! Oh, dear, how it flies!
[Briskly]	MASHA. We’ve unexpectedly met a fellow countryman.  I remember: Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a “lovelorn Major.” You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some reason they always called you a Major for fun.
[Laughs]	VERSHININ.  That’s it... the lovelorn Major, that’s got it!
[Crying]	IRINA. Eleven years. What are you crying for, Masha, you little fool....  And I’m crying too.
[Pause]	VERSHININ. Once I used to live in German Street. That was when the Red Barracks were my headquarters. There’s an ugly bridge in between, where the water rushes underneath. One gets melancholy when one is alone there.  Here the river is so wide and fine! It’s a splendid river!
[Pause]	VERSHININ. Yes, they’ll forget us. It’s our fate, it can’t be helped. A time will come when everything that seems serious, significant, or very important to us will be forgotten, or considered trivial.  And the curious thing is that we can’t possibly find out what will come to be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly. Didn’t the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary and ludicrous at first, while wasn’t it thought that some rubbish written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....
[Feebly]	SOLENI.  There, there, there.
[Applauds]	IRINA.  Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.
[Laughs]	VERSHININ. Well, I say!  You know a lot too much! I don’t think there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won’t be able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself, but still, you won’t disappear having influenced nobody; later on, others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on, until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred years’ time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew.  And you complain that you know too much.
[Sighs]	IRINA.  Yes, all that ought to be written down.
[Pause.]	TUZENBACH. Yes, we must work. You are probably thinking to yourself: the German lets himself go. But I assure you I’m a Russian, I can’t even speak German. My father belonged to the Orthodox Church.... 
[Laughs]	KULIGIN.  I couldn’t have, surely! You’d better give it back to me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel. You’ll read it some day when you’re bored.
[Bows]	VERSHININ.  I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive me, I didn’t know, and I didn’t offer you my congratulations. [Goes with OLGA into the dining-room.]
[Hurt]	KULIGIN.  My dear Masha, why not?
[Angrily]	MASHA. I’ll tell you later....  All right, I’ll go, only please stand back.... [Steps away.]
[Gaily]	KULIGIN.  Your health, Colonel! I’m a pedagogue and not quite at home here. I’m Masha’s husband.... She’s a good sort, a very good sort.
[Drinks]	VERSHININ. I’ll have some of this black vodka....  Your health! [To OLGA] I’m very comfortable here!
[Impatiently]	OLGA.  Andrey, when are you coming?
[Off]	ANDREY.  One minute. [Enters and goes to the table.]
[Pause]	TUZENBACH. He’s a queer man. I’m sorry for him, though he vexes me. I think he’s shy. When there are just the two of us he’s quite all right and very good company; when other people are about he’s rough and hectoring. Don’t let’s go in, let them have their meal without us. Let me stay with you. What are you thinking of?  You’re twenty. I’m not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long, long lines of days, filled with my love for you....
[Tearfully]	IRINA.  Phoo! How disgusting!
[Laughs.]	CHEBUTIKIN. Nature only brought us into the world that we should love! 
[Angrily]	ANDREY.  Please don’t! Aren’t you tired of it?
[Loudly]	RODE.  Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day, simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the morning. I take their drills.
[Tearfully]	 What am I saying that for? I’ve had those words running in my head all day....
[Aloud]	RODE.  Surely you don’t believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]
[Laughter.]	KULIGIN. If there are thirteen at table then it means there are lovers present. It isn’t you, Ivan Romanovitch, hang it all.... 
[Sighs]	NATASHA. And Olga and Irina aren’t in yet. The poor things are still at work. Olga at the teacher’s council, Irina at the telegraph office....  I said to your sister this morning, “Irina, darling, you must take care of yourself.” But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so frightened!
[Hesitatingly]	ANDREY.  But what about my sisters. This is their flat.
[Going]	NATASHA. They’ll do as I want them. They are so kind....  I ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk and nothing else, or you won’t get thin. [Stops] Bobby is so cold. I’m afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into another room till the warm weather comes. Irina’s room, for instance, is just right for a child: it’s dry and has the sun all day. I must tell her, she can share Olga’s room. It isn’t as if she was at home in the daytime, she only sleeps here.... [A pause] Andrey, darling, why are you so silent?
[Yawns]	ANDREY.  Call him here.
[Louder]	ANDREY. . I say you’ve come late, it’s past eight.
[Pause]	MASHA. I don’t know.  I don’t know. Of course, habit counts for a great deal. After father’s death, for instance, it took us a long time to get used to the absence of orderlies. But, apart from habit, it seems to me in all fairness that, however it may be in other towns, the best and most-educated people are army men.
[Pause]	VERSHININ. Perhaps I am. I haven’t had any dinner, I’ve had nothing since the morning. My daughter is a little unwell, and when my girls are ill, I get very anxious and my conscience tortures me because they have such a mother. Oh, if you had seen her to-day! What a trivial personality! We began quarrelling at seven in the morning and at nine I slammed the door and went out.  I never speak of her, it’s strange that I bear my complaints to you alone. [Kisses her hand] Don’t be angry with me. I haven’t anybody but you, nobody at all.... [Pause.]
[Laughing]	MASHA.  When you talk to me like that, I laugh; I don’t know why, for I’m afraid. Don’t repeat it, please.... [In an undertone] No, go on, it’s all the same to me.... [Covers her face with her hands] Somebody’s coming, let’s talk about something else.
[Smiling]	TUZENBACH.  When you come home from your work you seem so young, and so unfortunate.... [Pause.]
[Laughs]	IRINA. He lost money a fortnight ago, he lost money in December. Perhaps if he lost everything we should go away from this town. Oh, my God, I dream of Moscow every night. I’m just like a lunatic.  We go there in June, and before June there’s still... February, March, April, May... nearly half a year!
[Laughs]	IRINA.  No. He’s been here eight months and hasn’t paid a copeck. Seems to have forgotten.
[Laughs]	MASHA.  What dignity in his pose! [They all laugh. A pause.]
[Thoughtfully]	VERSHININ.  How can I put it? It seems to me that everything on earth must change, little by little, and is already changing under our very eyes. After two or three hundred years, after a thousand--the actual time doesn’t matter--a new and happy age will begin. We, of course, shall not take part in it, but we live and work and even suffer to-day that it should come. We create it--and in that one object is our destiny and, if you like, our happiness.
[Pause]	VERSHININ. I finished my education at the same point as you, I have not studied at universities; I read a lot, but I cannot choose my books and perhaps what I read is not at all what I should, but the longer I love, the more I want to know. My hair is turning white, I am nearly an old man now, but I know so little, oh, so little! But I think I know the things that matter most, and that are most real. I know them well. And I wish I could make you understand that there is no happiness for us, that there should not and cannot be.... We must only work and work, and happiness is only for our distant posterity.  If not for me, then for the descendants of my descendants.
[Pause.]	TUZENBACH. A meaning.... Now the snow is falling. What meaning? 
[Reading]	CHEBUTIKIN.  Balzac was married at Berdichev. [IRINA is singing softly] That’s worth making a note of. [He makes a note] Balzac was married at Berdichev. [Goes on reading.]
[Loudly]	RODE.  Doctor, how old are you?
[Laughter]	CHEBUTIKIN. I? Thirty-two. 
[Laughs]	FEDOTIK. No, it won’t come out. Look, the eight was on the two of spades.  That means you won’t go to Moscow.
[Quietly]	VERSHININ.  My wife has poisoned herself again. I must go. I’ll go out quietly. It’s all awfully unpleasant. [Kisses MASHA’S hand] My dear, my splendid, good woman... I’ll go this way, quietly. [Exit.]
[Angrily]	MASHA.  Be quiet! You bother so one can’t have a moment’s peace.... [Goes to the table with her cup] I’m tired of you, old woman!
[Mocking]	ANFISA.  Anfisa! He sits there and... [Exit.]
[Sighs]	NATASHA.  Dear Masha, why use such expressions? With your beautiful exterior you would be simply fascinating in good society, I tell you so directly, if it wasn’t for your words. _Je vous prie, pardonnez moi, Marie, mais vous avez des manières un peu grossières_.
[Exit.]	NATASHA. _Il parait, que mon Bobick déjà ne dort pas_, he has awakened. He isn’t well to-day. I’ll go to him, excuse me... 
[Declaims]	SOLENI.  “I am strange, but who is not? Don’t be angry, Aleko!”
[Pause.]	TUZENBACH. And what has Aleko to do with it? 
[Declaims]	SOLENI.  “Do not be angry, Aleko... forget, forget, thy dreams of yore....”
[Imploring]	ANDREY.  Please, please! I ask you!
[Dances]	CHEBUTIKIN. 
[Laughter.]	“Its walls are like a sieve!” 
[Laughs]	TUZENBACH. Bravo, bravo!  Come on, now. I’m going to play. Funny man, Soleni.... [Goes to the piano and plays a waltz.]
[Loudly]	RODE.  I slept late after dinner to-day because I thought I was going to dance all night. It’s only nine o’clock now!
[Enters]	IRINA.  What’s that?
[Whispers]	ANFISA.  The entertainers! [Bell.]
[Coldly]	IRINA.  Stop it, Vassili Vassilevitch!
[Exit.]	SOLENI. It’s all the same to me. Good-bye! 
[Sits]	OLGA. My committee meeting is only just over. I’m tired out. Our chairwoman is ill, so I had to take her place. My head, my head is aching....  Andrey lost 200 roubles at cards yesterday... the whole town is talking about it....
[Sits.]	KULIGIN. Yes, my meeting tired me too. 
[Going]	OLGA. I’ve such a headache... Andrey has been losing money.... The whole town is talking.... I’ll go and lie down.  I’m free to-morrow.... Oh, my God, what a mercy! I’m free to-morrow, I’m free the day after.... Oh my head, my head.... [Exit.]
[alone]	IRINA.  They’ve all gone. Nobody’s left.
[Rings]	OLGA.  They’ll never answer.... [At the door] Come here, whoever there is! [Through the open door can be seen a window, red with flame: afire-engine is heard passing the house] How awful this is. And how I’m sick of it! [FERAPONT enters] Take these things down.... The Kolotilin girls are down below... and let them have them. This, too.
[Exit.]	FERAPONT. Yes’m. 
[Tired]	ANFISA.  Olga, dear girl, don’t dismiss me! Don’t dismiss me!
[Confusedly]	OLGA.  Excuse me, I don’t understand either...
[Excited]	NATASHA.  Forgive me, Olga, forgive me... I didn’t want to annoy you.
[Surprised]	NATASHA.  What do you mean? She’s only a servant. [Crying] I don’t understand you, Olga. I’ve got a nurse, a wet-nurse, we’ve a cook, a housemaid... what do we want that old woman for as well? What good is she? [Fire-alarm behind the stage.]
[Stamping]	NATASHA. We must come to an agreement, Olga. Your place is the school, mine--the home. You devote yourself to teaching, I, to the household. And if I talk about servants, then I do know what I am talking about; I do know what I am talking about... And to-morrow there’s to be no more of that old thief, that old hag...  that witch! And don’t you dare to annoy me! Don’t you dare! [Stopping short] Really, if you don’t move downstairs, we shall always be quarrelling. This is awful.
[Angrily]	CHEBUTIKIN.  Devil take them all... take them all.... They think I’m a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely nothing, I’ve forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely nothing. [OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him] Devil take it. Last Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip--and she died, and it’s my fault that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount five-and-twenty years ago, but I don’t remember anything now. Nothing. Perhaps I’m not really a man, and am only pretending that I’ve got arms and legs and a head; perhaps I don’t exist at all, and only imagine that I walk, and eat, and sleep. [Cries] Oh, if only I didn’t exist! [Stops crying; angrily] The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were talking in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I’d never read, never read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so did the others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the woman I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn’t get her out of my mind, and everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went and drank....
[Laughs]	KULIGIN.  Speaking’s a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch! [Pats him on the shoulder] Good man! _In vino veritas_, the ancients used to say.
[Sighs]	KULIGIN.  Yes.... But will it be quite all right for her to take part in a concert? [Pause] You see, I don’t know anything about it. Perhaps it will even be all to the good. Although I must admit that our Director is a good man, a very good man even, a very clever man, still he has such views.... Of course it isn’t his business but still, if you wish it, perhaps I’d better talk to him.
[Pause]	VERSHININ. I got so dirty while the fire was on, I don’t look like anybody on earth.  Yesterday I happened to hear, casually, that they want to transfer our brigade to some distant place. Some said to Poland, others, to Chita.
[Laughs]	VERSHININ. Yes.  How strange everything really is! [Pause] When the fire broke out, I hurried off home; when I get there I see the house is whole, uninjured, and in no danger, but my two girls are standing by the door in just their underclothes, their mother isn’t there, the crowd is excited, horses and dogs are running about, and the girls’ faces are so agitated, terrified, beseeching, and I don’t know what else. My heart was pained when I saw those faces. My God, I thought, what these girls will have to put up with if they live long! I caught them up and ran, and still kept on thinking the one thing: what they will have to live through in this world! [Fire-alarm; a pause] I come here and find their mother shouting and angry. [MASHA enters with a pillow and sits on the sofa] And when my girls were standing by the door in just their underclothes, and the street was red from the fire, there was a dreadful noise, and I thought that something of the sort used to happen many years ago when an enemy made a sudden attack, and looted, and burned.... And at the same time what a difference there really is between the present and the past! And when a little more time has gone by, in two or three hundred years perhaps, people will look at our present life with just the same fear, and the same contempt, and the whole past will seem clumsy and dull, and very uncomfortable, and strange. Oh, indeed, what a life there will be, what a life!  Forgive me, I’ve dropped into philosophy again. Please let me continue. I do awfully want to philosophize, it’s just how I feel at present. [Pause] As if they are all asleep. As I was saying: what a life there will be! Only just imagine.... There are only three persons like yourselves in the town just now, but in future generations there will be more and more, and still more, and the time will come when everything will change and become as you would have it, people will live as you do, and then you too will go out of date; people will be born who are better than you....  Yes, to-day I am quite exceptionally in the vein. I am devilishly keen on living.... [Sings.]
[Laughs.]	“The power of love all ages know, From its assaults great good does grow.” 
[Laughs.]	VERSHININ. Tra-ta-ta. 
[Dancing]	FEDOTIK.  I’m burnt out, I’m burnt out! Down to the ground! [Laughter.]
[Laughs]	FEDOTIK.  Absolutely. Nothing left at all. The guitar’s burnt, and the photographs are burnt, and all my correspondence.... And I was going to make you a present of a note-book, and that’s burnt too.
[Waking]	TUZENBACH.  I am tired, I must say.... The brickworks.... No, I’m not wandering, I mean it; I’m going to start work soon at the brickworks... I’ve already talked it over. [Tenderly, to IRINA] You’re so pale, and beautiful, and charming.... Your paleness seems to shine through the dark air as if it was a light.... You are sad, displeased with life.... Oh, come with me, let’s go and work together!
[Laughs]	TUZENBACH.  Are you here? I didn’t see you. [Kisses IRINA’S hand] good-bye, I’ll go... I look at you now and I remember, as if it was long ago, your name-day, when you, cheerfully and merrily, were talking about the joys of labour.... And how happy life seemed to me, then! What has happened to it now? [Kisses her hand] There are tears in your eyes. Go to bed now; it is already day... the morning begins.... If only I was allowed to give my life for you!
[Exit.]	TUZENBACH. I’m off. 
[Angrily]	MASHA.  Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant.
[Laughs]	KULIGIN.  No, she really is wonderful. I’ve been your husband seven years, and it seems as if I was only married yesterday. On my word. No, you really are a wonderful woman. I’m satisfied, I’m satisfied, I’m satisfied!
[Pause]	MASHA. I don’t want anything, but the unfairness of it disgusts me.  You go, Feodor.
[Nervily]	IRINA. Yes, really, our Andrey has grown smaller; how he’s snuffed out and aged with that woman! He used to want to be a professor, and yesterday he was boasting that at last he had been made a member of the district council. He is a member, and Protopopov is chairman.... The whole town talks and laughs about it, and he alone knows and sees nothing.... And now everybody’s gone to look at the fire, but he sits alone in his room and pays no attention, only just plays on his fiddle.  Oh, it’s awful, awful, awful. [Weeps] I can’t, I can’t bear it any longer!... I can’t, I can’t!... [OLGA comes in and clears up at her little table. IRINA is sobbing loudly] Throw me out, throw me out, I can’t bear any more!
[Alarmed]	OLGA.  What is it, what is it? Dear!
[Sobbing]	IRINA.  Where? Where has everything gone? Where is it all? Oh my God, my God! I’ve forgotten everything, everything... I don’t remember what is the Italian for window or, well, for ceiling... I forget everything, every day I forget it, and life passes and will never return, and we’ll never go away to Moscow... I see that we’ll never go....
[Pause.]	OLGA. Masha, you’re silly, you’re the silliest of the family. Please forgive me for saying so. 
[Softly]	MASHA. I want to make a confession, dear sisters. My soul is in pain. I will confess to you, and never again to anybody... I’ll tell you this minute.  It’s my secret but you must know everything... I can’t be silent.... [Pause] I love, I love... I love that man.... You saw him only just now.... Why don’t I say it... in one word. I love Vershinin.
[Angrily]	ANDREY.  What do you want? I don’t understand.
[Excited]	OLGA. Please don’t, Audrey dear. We’ll talk to-morrow.  What an awful night!
[Pause]	ANDREY. I’ll only say this and go. Just now.... In the first place, you’ve got something against Natasha, my wife; I’ve noticed it since the very day of my marriage. Natasha is a beautiful and honest creature, straight and honourable--that’s my opinion. I love and respect my wife; understand it, I respect her, and I insist that others should respect her too. I repeat, she’s an honest and honourable person, and all your disapproval is simply silly...  In the second place, you seem to be annoyed because I am not a professor, and am not engaged in study. But I work for the zemstvo, I am a member of the district council, and I consider my service as worthy and as high as the service of science. I am a member of the district council, and I am proud of it, if you want to know.  In the third place, I have still this to say... that I have mortgaged the house without obtaining your permission.... For that I am to blame, and ask to be forgiven. My debts led me into doing it... thirty-five thousand... I do not play at cards any more, I stopped long ago, but the chief thing I have to say in my defence is that you girls receive a pension, and I don’t... my wages, so to speak.... [Pause.]
[Pause]	IRINA. What a restless night!  Olga! [Looks out] Did you hear? They are taking the brigade away from us; it’s going to be transferred to some place far away.
[Grieved]	FEDOTIK.  Don’t be in such a hurry!
[Shouts]	RODE.  Yo-ho!
[Shouts]	KULIGIN.  Good-bye!
[Sits.]	KULIGIN. Well! It’s the custom, it’s modus vivendi. Our Director is clean-shaven, and so I too, when I received my inspectorship, had my moustaches removed. Nobody likes it, but it’s all one to me. I’m satisfied. Whether I’ve got moustaches or not, I’m satisfied.... 
[Laughs]	KULIGIN. At some seminary or other a master wrote “bunkum” on an essay, and the student couldn’t make the letters out--thought it was a Latin word “luckum.”  Awfully funny, that. They say that Soleni is in love with Irina and hates the Baron.... That’s quite natural. Irina is a very nice girl. She’s even like Masha, she’s so thoughtful.... Only, Irina your character is gentler. Though Masha’s character, too, is a very good one. I’m very fond of Masha. [Shouts of “Yo-ho!” are heard behind the stage.]
[Shudders]	IRINA.  Everything seems to frighten me today. [Pause] I’ve got everything ready, and I send my things off after dinner. The Baron and I will be married to-morrow, and to-morrow we go away to the brickworks, and the next day I go to the school, and the new life begins. God will help me! When I took my examination for the teacher’s post, I actually wept for joy and gratitude.... [Pause] The cart will be here in a minute for my things....
[Sighs]	KULIGIN. Oh, drop it!  To-day the soldiers will be gone, and everything will go on as in the old days. Say what you will, Masha is a good, honest woman. I love her very much, and thank my fate for her. People have such different fates. There’s a Kosirev who works in the excise department here. He was at school with me; he was expelled from the fifth class of the High School for being entirely unable to understand _ut consecutivum_. He’s awfully hard up now and in very poor health, and when I meet him I say to him, “How do you do, _ut consecutivum_.” “Yes,” he says, “precisely _consecutivum_...” and coughs. But I’ve been successful all my life, I’m happy, and I even have a Stanislaus Cross, of the second class, and now I myself teach others that _ut consecutivum_. Of course, I’m a clever man, much cleverer than many, but happiness doesn’t only lie in that....
[Pause]	IRINA. To-morrow night I shan’t hear that “Maiden’s Prayer” any more, and I shan’t be meeting Protopopov....  Protopopov is sitting there in the drawing-room; and he came to-day...
[Sits]	MASHA.  Nothing.... [Pause] Did you love my mother?
[Pause]	ANDREY. The town will grow empty. It will be as if they put a cover over it.  Something happened yesterday by the theatre. The whole town knows of it, but I don’t.
[Pause.]	CHEBUTIKIN. What about the Baron? 
[Going]	MASHA. You talk and talk the whole day long.  You live in a climate like this, where it might snow any moment, and there you talk.... [Stops] I won’t go into the house, I can’t go there.... Tell me when Vershinin comes.... [Goes along the avenue] The migrant birds are already on the wing.... [Looks up] Swans or geese.... My dear, happy things.... [Exit.]
[Rises]	CHEBUTIKIN.  I’m going away to-morrow, old chap, and perhaps we’ll never meet again, so here’s my advice. Put on your cap, take a stick in your hand, go... go on and on, without looking round. And the farther you go, the better.
[Angry]	CHEBUTIKIN.  Mind your own business.
[Irritated]	ANDREY. . Go away! Leave me! Please! [Goes away with the perambulator.]
[Pause]	IRINA. One can understand that.  The town will be empty.
[Pause]	IRINA. It’s not true... Nicolai, why are you so absentminded to-day?  What took place by the theatre yesterday?
[Cries]	IRINA. It isn’t in my power! I shall be your wife, I shall be true to you, and obedient to you, but I can’t love you. What can I do!  I have never been in love in my life. Oh, I used to think so much of love, I have been thinking about it for so long by day and by night, but my soul is like an expensive piano which is locked and the key lost. [Pause] You seem so unhappy.
[Pause]	TUZENBACH. I didn’t sleep at night. There is nothing in my life so awful as to be able to frighten me, only that lost key torments my soul and does not let me sleep. Say something to me  say something to me....
[Pause.]	IRINA. Don’t! don’t! 
[Nervously]	TUZENBACH.  No, no! [He goes quickly and stops in the avenue] Irina!
[Confused]	ANDREY.  I’m speaking quietly.
[Shouts]	ANFISA. I’ll go and look, too.  Little Masha, co-ee! [Goes out with IRINA down into the garden] Co-ee, co-ee!
[Pause]	VERSHININ. Probably not.  My wife and both my daughters will stay here another two months. If anything happens, or if anything has to be done...
[Pause]	OLGA. Yes, yes, of course. You need not worry.  To-morrow there won’t be a single soldier left in the town, it will all be a memory, and, of course, for us a new life will begin....  None of our plans are coming right. I didn’t want to be a head-mistress, but they made me one, all the same. It means there’s no chance of Moscow....
[Laughs]	VERSHININ. What else can I say in parting? Can I philosophize about anything?  Life is heavy. To many of us it seems dull and hopeless, but still, it must be acknowledged that it is getting lighter and clearer, and it seems that the time is not far off when it will be quite clear. [Looks at his watch] It’s time I went! Mankind used to be absorbed in wars, and all its existence was filled with campaigns, attacks, defeats, now we’ve outlived all that, leaving after us a great waste place, which there is nothing to fill with at present; but mankind is looking for something, and will certainly find it. Oh, if it only happened more quickly. [Pause] If only education could be added to industry, and industry to education. [Looks at his watch] It’s time I went....
[Confused]	KULIGIN.  Never mind, let her cry, let her.... My dear Masha, my good Masha.... You’re my wife, and I’m happy, whatever happens... I’m not complaining, I don’t reproach you at all.... Olga is a witness to it. Let’s begin to live again as we used to, and not by a single word, or hint...
[Angrily]	MASHA.  I shan’t go in there. [Sobs, but controls herself at once] I’m not going to go into the house, I won’t go....
[Pause.]	IRINA. Let’s sit here together and say nothing. I’m going away to-morrow.... 
[Laughs]	OLGA.  Yes. [MASHA weeps.]
[Sighs]	NATASHA. That means I shall have the place to myself to-morrow.  In the first place I shall have that avenue of fir-trees cut down, then that maple. It’s so ugly at nights.... [To IRINA] That belt doesn’t suit you at all, dear.... It’s an error of taste. And I’ll give orders to have lots and lots of little flowers planted here, and they’ll smell.... [Severely] Why is there a fork lying about here on the seat? [Going towards the house, to the maid] Why is there a fork lying about here on the seat, I say? [Shouts] Don’t you dare to answer me!
[Pause]	OLGA. What is it?  What is it?
[Frightened]	OLGA.  It can’t be true!
[Sadly]	CHEBUTIKIN. Yes... such a story... I’m tired out, exhausted, I won’t say any more....  Still, it’s all the same!
[Cries.]	IRINA. What is it? Tell me quickly, what is it? For God’s sake! 
[Listening]	DUNYASHA. I thought you’d gone away.  I think I hear them coming.
[Listens]	LOPAKHIN.  No.... They’ve got to collect their luggage and so on.... [Pause] Lubov Andreyevna has been living abroad for five years; I don’t know what she’ll be like now.... She’s a good sort--an easy, simple person. I remember when I was a boy of fifteen, my father, who is dead--he used to keep a shop in the village here--hit me on the face with his fist, and my nose bled.... We had gone into the yard together for something or other, and he was a little drunk. Lubov Andreyevna, as I remember her now, was still young, and very thin, and she took me to the washstand here in this very room, the nursery. She said, “Don’t cry, little man, it’ll be all right in time for your wedding.” [Pause] “Little man”.... My father was a peasant, it’s true, but here I am in a white waistcoat and yellow shoes... a pearl out of an oyster. I’m rich now, with lots of money, but just think about it and examine me, and you’ll find I’m still a peasant down to the marrow of my bones. [Turns over the pages of his book] Here I’ve been reading this book, but I understood nothing. I read and fell asleep. [Pause.]
[Exit.]	DUNYASHA. Very well. 
[Sighs]	EPIKHODOV. There’s a frost this morning--three degrees, and the cherry-trees are all in flower. I can’t approve of our climate.  I can’t. Our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. And, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?
[Listens]	LOPAKHIN.  There they come, I think.
[Excited]	DUNYASHA.  I shall faint in a minute.... Oh, I’m fainting!
[Weeps]	LUBOV. My dear nursery, oh, you beautiful room.... I used to sleep here when I was a baby.  And here I am like a little girl again. [Kisses her brother, VARYA, then her brother again] And Varya is just as she used to be, just like a nun. And I knew Dunyasha. [Kisses her.]
[Astonished]	PISCHIN.  To think of that, now!
[Tired]	ANYA.  Something else now...?
[Joyfully]	ANYA.  Peter!
[Exit.]	DUNYASHA. This minute. 
[Weeping]	VARYA.  Don’t say any more, don’t say any more....
[Sadly]	ANYA.  Mother bought it. [Goes into her room, and talks lightly, like a child] In Paris I went up in a balloon!
[Thoughtfully]	ANYA.  Father died six years ago, and a month later my brother Grisha was drowned in the river--such a dear little boy of seven! Mother couldn’t bear it; she went away, away, without looking round.... [Shudders] How I understand her; if only she knew! [Pause] And Peter Trofimov was Grisha’s tutor, he might tell her....
[Joyfully]	FIERS. I beg your pardon?  The mistress is home again. I’ve lived to see her! Don’t care if I die now.... [Weeps with joy.]
[Laughs]	LUBOV.  You’re just the same as ever, Varya. [Draws her close and kisses her] I’ll have some coffee now, then we’ll all go. [FIERS lays a cushion under her feet] Thank you, dear. I’m used to coffee. I drink it day and night. Thank you, dear old man. [Kisses FIERS.]
[Exit.]	VARYA. I’ll go and see if they’ve brought in all the luggage. 
[Laughs]	LUBOV. Is it really I who am sitting here?  I want to jump about and wave my arms. [Covers her face with her hands] But suppose I’m dreaming! God knows I love my own country, I love it deeply; I couldn’t look out of the railway carriage, I cried so much. [Through her tears] Still, I must have my coffee. Thank you, Fiers. Thank you, dear old man. I’m so glad you’re still with us.
[Angry]	GAEV.  What rot!
[Astonished]	PISCHIN.  A hundred years.... Think of that!
[Frightened]	LUBOV.  You’re off your head!
[Mumbles.]	FIERS. They were here in Easter week and ate half a pailful of cucumbers.... 
[Exit.]	CHARLOTTA. It’s not necessary. I want to go to bed. 
[Angrily]	VARYA.  Do go, now!
[Exit.]	LOPAKHIN. I’m going, I’m going.... 
[Frightened]	VARYA.  We haven’t got it, we haven’t got it!
[Laughs]	PISCHIN. I’ll find it all right  I never lose hope. I used to think, “Everything’s lost now. I’m a dead man,” when, lo and behold, a railway was built over my land... and they paid me for it. And something else will happen to-day or to-morrow. Dashenka may win 20,000 roubles... she’s got a lottery ticket.
[Quietly]	VARYA.  Anya’s asleep. [Opens window quietly] The sun has risen already; it isn’t cold. Look, little mother: what lovely trees! And the air! The starlings are singing!
[Crying]	VARYA.  It’s Peter Trofimov.
[Confused]	GAEV.  That’s enough, that’s enough, Luba.
[Weeps]	VARYA.  But I told you, Peter, to wait till to-morrow.
[Grins]	YASHA.  You are just the same as ever, Leonid Andreyevitch.
[Exit.]	YASHA. A lot of use there is in her coming. She might have come tomorrow just as well. 
[Pause]	GAEV. Yes....  If there’s any illness for which people offer many remedies, you may be sure that particular illness is incurable, I think. I work my brains to their hardest. I’ve several remedies, very many, and that really means I’ve none at all. It would be nice to inherit a fortune from somebody, it would be nice to marry our Anya to a rich man, it would be nice to go to Yaroslav and try my luck with my aunt the Countess. My aunt is very, very rich.
[Weeps]	VARYA.  If only God helped us.
[Whispers]	VARYA.  Anya’s in the doorway.
[Pause]	GAEV. Really?  It’s curious, something’s got into my right eye... I can’t see properly out of it. And on Thursday, when I was at the District Court...
[Reproachfully]	FIERS.  Leonid Andreyevitch, don’t you fear God? When are you going to bed?
[Angrily]	FIERS.  Leonid Andreyevitch!
[Yawns]	VARYA. It’s time to go to sleep. I’ll go. There’s been an unpleasantness here while you were away. In the old servants’ part of the house, as you know, only the old people live--little old Efim and Polya and Evstigney, and Karp as well. They started letting some tramps or other spend the night there--I said nothing. Then I heard that they were saying that I had ordered them to be fed on peas and nothing else; from meanness, you see.... And it was all Evstigney’s doing.... Very well, I thought, if that’s what the matter is, just you wait. So I call Evstigney....  He comes. “What’s this,” I say, “Evstigney, you old fool.”... [Looks at ANYA] Anya dear! [Pause] She’s dropped off.... [Takes ANYA’S arm] Let’s go to bye-bye.... Come along!... [Leads her] My darling’s gone to sleep! Come on.... [They go. In the distance, the other side of the orchard, a shepherd plays his pipe. TROFIMOV crosses the stage and stops on seeing VARYA and ANYA] Sh! She’s asleep, asleep. Come on, dear.
[Moved]	TROFIMOV.  My sun! My spring!
[Thoughtfully]	CHARLOTTA.  I haven’t a real passport. I don’t know how old I am, and I think I’m young. When I was a little girl my father and mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used to do the _salto mortale_ and various little things. And when papa and mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I liked it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and who I am, I don’t know.... Who my parents were--perhaps they weren’t married--I don’t know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] I don’t know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I haven’t anybody to talk to... I haven’t anybody at all.
[Sings]	EPIKHODOV. For the enamoured madman, this is a mandoline. 
[Sighs.]	EPIKHODOV. I should prefer to be alone with you. 
[Shy]	DUNYASHA.  Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It’s by the cupboard. It’s a little damp here.
[Yawns.]	YASHA. Two-and-twenty troubles! A silly man, between you and me and the gatepost. 
[Pause]	DUNYASHA. I hope to goodness he won’t shoot himself.  I’m so nervous, I’m worried. I went into service when I was quite a little girl, and now I’m not used to common life, and my hands are white, white as a lady’s. I’m so tender and so delicate now; respectable and afraid of everything.... I’m so frightened. And I don’t know what will happen to my nerves if you deceive me, Yasha.
[Pause.]	DUNYASHA. I’m awfully in love with you; you’re educated, you can talk about everything. 
[Yawns]	YASHA.  Yes. I think this: if a girl loves anybody, then that means she’s immoral. [Pause] It’s nice to smoke a cigar out in the open air.... [Listens] Somebody’s coming. It’s the mistress, and people with her. [DUNYASHA embraces him suddenly] Go to the house, as if you’d been bathing in the river; go by this path, or they’ll meet you and will think I’ve been meeting you. I can’t stand that sort of thing.
[Sits.]	LUBOV. Who’s smoking horrible cigars here? 
[Sits]	GAEV. They built that railway; that’s made this place very handy.  Went to town and had lunch... red in the middle! I’d like to go in now and have just one game.
[Imploringly]	LOPAKHIN. Just one word!  Give me an answer!
[Yawns]	GAEV.  Really!
[Laughs]	YASHA.  I can’t listen to your voice without laughing.
[Frightened]	LUBOV.  No, don’t go away, do stop; be a dear. Please. Perhaps we’ll find some way out!
[Pause]	LUBOV. Please don’t go away. It’s nicer when you’re here....  I keep on waiting for something to happen, as if the house is going to collapse over our heads.
[Listens]	LOPAKHIN.  I can’t hear.... [Sings quietly] “For money will the Germans make a Frenchman of a Russian.” [Laughs] I saw such an awfully funny thing at the theatre last night.
[Pause]	LOPAKHIN. It’s true. To speak the straight truth, we live a silly life.  My father was a peasant, an idiot, he understood nothing, he didn’t teach me, he was always drunk, and always used a stick on me. In point of fact, I’m a fool and an idiot too. I’ve never learned anything, my handwriting is bad, I write so that I’m quite ashamed before people, like a pig!
[Pause.]	LOPAKHIN. Well? I don’t mind... she’s a nice girl. 
[Laughs]	FIERS. I’ve been alive a long time. They were already getting ready to marry me before your father was born....  And when the Emancipation came I was already first valet. Only I didn’t agree with the Emancipation and remained with my people.... [Pause] I remember everybody was happy, but they didn’t know why.
[Tenderly]	LUBOV.  Come, come, my dears.... [Embracing ANYA and VARYA] If you two only knew how much I love you. Sit down next to me, like that. [All sit down.]
[Laughs]	LOPAKHIN.  I wonder what you think of me?
[Ironically]	LOPAKHIN.  Oh, awfully!
[Thoughtfully]	ANYA.  Epikhodov’s there.
[Entreatingly]	VARYA.  Uncle, dear!
[Shudders]	LUBOV.  It’s unpleasant, somehow. [A pause.]
[Hiccups]	TRAMP. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Lovely weather.... [Declaims] My brother, my suffering brother.... Come out on the Volga, you whose groans... [To VARYA] Mademoiselle, please give a hungry Russian thirty copecks....
[Angrily]	LOPAKHIN.  There’s manners everybody’s got to keep!
[Frightened]	VARYA.  I’m going, I’m going.... Oh, little mother, at home there’s nothing for the servants to eat, and you gave him gold.
[Crying]	VARYA.  You shouldn’t joke about this, mother.
[Laughs]	ANYA.  Thanks to the tramp who frightened Barbara, we’re alone now.
[Pause]	TROFIMOV. All Russia is our orchard. The land is great and beautiful, there are many marvellous places in it.  Think, Anya, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, and all your ancestors were serf-owners, they owned living souls; and now, doesn’t something human look at you from every cherry in the orchard, every leaf and every stalk? Don’t you hear voices...? Oh, it’s awful, your orchard is terrible; and when in the evening or at night you walk through the orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred years ago, and are oppressed by their heavy visions. Still, at any rate, we’ve left those two hundred years behind us. So far we’ve gained nothing at all--we don’t yet know what the past is to be to us--we only philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. For it’s so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must first redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by strenuous, uninterrupted labour. Understand that, Anya.
[Enthusiastically]	ANYA.  How nicely you said that!
[Thoughtful]	ANYA.  The moon is rising.
[Pause]	TROFIMOV. Yes, the moon has risen.  There is happiness, there it comes; it comes nearer and nearer; I hear its steps already. And if we do not see it we shall not know it, but what does that matter? Others will see it!
[Angry]	TROFIMOV. That’s Varya again!  Disgraceful!
[Sits]	PISCHIN. I’m full-blooded and have already had two strokes; it’s hard for me to dance, but, as they say, if you’re in Rome, you must do as Rome does. I’ve got the strength of a horse. My dead father, who liked a joke, peace to his bones, used to say, talking of our ancestors, that the ancient stock of the Simeonov-Pischins was descended from that identical horse that Caligula made a senator....  But the trouble is, I’ve no money! A hungry dog only believes in meat. [Snores and wakes up again immediately] So I... only believe in money....
[Teasing]	TROFIMOV.  Madame Lopakhin! Madame Lopakhin!
[Angry]	VARYA.  Decayed gentleman!
[Bitterly]	VARYA.  We’ve hired the musicians, but how are they to be paid? [Exit.]
[Applauds]	STATION-MASTER.  Madame ventriloquist, bravo!
[Surprised]	PISCHIN.  Think of that, now! Delightful, Charlotte Ivanovna... I’m simply in love....
[Astonished]	PISCHIN.  Think of that now!
[Applauds]	LUBOV.  Bravo, bravo!
[Astonished]	PISCHIN.  Think of that, now.
[Sarcastically]	TROFIMOV.  Oh, yes!
[Angry]	VARYA.  Eternal student! He’s already been expelled twice from the university.
[Exit.]	VARYA. Why is Epikhodov here? Who said he could play billiards? I don’t understand these people. 
[Weeping]	TROFIMOV.  For God’s sake forgive my speaking candidly, but that man has robbed you!
[Angry]	LUBOV. You ought to be a man, at your age you ought to be able to understand those who love. And you ought to be in love yourself, you must fall in love!  Yes, yes! You aren’t pure, you’re just a freak, a queer fellow, a funny growth...
[Yawns]	YASHA. I’m tired of you, grandfather.  If you’d only hurry up and kick the bucket.
[Mutters.]	FIERS. Oh you... bungler! 
[Sits]	LUBOV. _Merci_. I’ll sit down.  I’m tired.
[Excited]	ANYA.  Somebody in the kitchen was saying just now that the cherry orchard was sold to-day.
[Laughs.]	YASHA. Oh, but he’s been gone a long time, the old man. 
[Yawns]	YASHA.  Impolite.... [Exit.]
[Sighs]	EPIKHODOV. You, Avdotya Fedorovna, want to see me no more than if I was some insect.  Oh, life!
[Sighs]	EPIKHODOV. Undoubtedly, perhaps, you may be right.  But, certainly, if you regard the matter from the aspect, then you, if I may say so, and you must excuse my candidness, have absolutely reduced me to a state of mind. I know my fate, every day something unfortunate happens to me, and I’ve grown used to it a long time ago, I even look at my fate with a smile. You gave me your word, and though I...
[Offended]	EPIKHODOV.  Whether I work, or walk about, or eat, or play billiards, is only a matter to be settled by people of understanding and my elders.
[Furious]	VARYA. You dare to talk to me like that!  You dare? You mean that I know nothing? Get out of here! This minute!
[Nervous]	EPIKHODOV.  I must ask you to express yourself more delicately.
[Excited]	LUBOV.  Well, what? Is it sold? Tell me?
[Laughs]	LOPAKHIN. I bought it! Wait, ladies and gentlemen, please, my head’s going round, I can’t talk....  When we got to the sale, Deriganov was there already. Leonid Andreyevitch had only fifteen thousand roubles, and Deriganov offered thirty thousand on top of the mortgage to begin with. I saw how matters were, so I grabbed hold of him and bid forty. He went up to forty-five, I offered fifty-five. That means he went up by fives and I went up by tens.... Well, it came to an end. I bid ninety more than the mortgage; and it stayed with me. The cherry orchard is mine now, mine! [Roars with laughter] My God, my God, the cherry orchard’s mine! Tell me I’m drunk, or mad, or dreaming.... [Stamps his feet] Don’t laugh at me! If my father and grandfather rose from their graves and looked at the whole affair, and saw how their Ermolai, their beaten and uneducated Ermolai, who used to run barefoot in the winter, how that very Ermolai has bought an estate, which is the most beautiful thing in the world! I’ve bought the estate where my grandfather and my father were slaves, where they weren’t even allowed into the kitchen. I’m asleep, it’s only a dream, an illusion.... It’s the fruit of imagination, wrapped in the fog of the unknown.... [Picks up the keys, nicely smiling] She threw down the keys, she wanted to show she was no longer mistress here.... [Jingles keys] Well, it’s all one! [Hears the band tuning up] Eh, musicians, play, I want to hear you! Come and look at Ermolai Lopakhin laying his axe to the cherry orchard, come and look at the trees falling! We’ll build villas here, and our grandsons and great-grandsons will see a new life here.... Play on, music! [The band plays. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA sinks into a chair and weeps bitterly. LOPAKHIN continues reproachfully] Why then, why didn’t you take my advice? My poor, dear woman, you can’t go back now. [Weeps] Oh, if only the whole thing was done with, if only our uneven, unhappy life were changed!
[Ironically]	LOPAKHIN. What’s that? Bandsmen, play nicely! Go on, do just as I want you to!  The new owner, the owner of the cherry orchard is coming! [He accidentally knocks up against a little table and nearly upsets the candelabra] I can pay for everything! [Exit with PISCHIN]
[Drinks]	YASHA. To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!  I can assure you that this isn’t real champagne.
[Pause]	LOPAKHIN. Eight roubles a bottle.  It’s devilish cold here.
[Laughs]	YASHA. There are no fires to-day, we’re going away. 
[Nervously]	TROFIMOV. Yes, I have, thank you; I’ve got some for a translation. Here it is in my pocket.  But I can’t find my goloshes!
[Pause]	TROFIMOV. I will.  I’ll get there and show others the way. [Axes cutting the trees are heard in the distance.]
[Exit.]	TROFIMOV. Yes, really, you ought to have enough tact not to do that. 
[Exit.]	LOPAKHIN, All right, all right... yes, he’s right. 
[Offended]	YASHA.  I told Egor this morning. What’s the use of asking ten times!
[Grinning]	YASHA.  Two-and-twenty troubles.
[Exit.]	ANYA. It’ll have to be sent after him. 
[Gaily]	GAEV.  Yes, really, everything’s all right now. Before the cherry orchard was sold we all were excited and we suffered, and then, when the question was solved once and for all, we all calmed down, and even became cheerful. I’m a bank official now, and a financier... red in the middle; and you, Luba, for some reason or other, look better, there’s no doubt about it.
[Hums]	CHARLOTTA. I’ve nowhere to live in town. I must go away.  Never mind.
[Puffing]	PISCHIN.  Oh, let me get my breath back.... I’m fagged out... My most honoured, give me some water....
[Exit.]	GAEV. Come for money, what? I’m your humble servant, and I’m going out of the way of temptation. 
[Drinks]	PISCHIN. I’ve leased off the land with the clay to them for twenty-four years.... Now, excuse me, I’ve no time.... I must run off.... I must go to Znoikov and to Kardamonov... I owe them all money....  Good-bye. I’ll come in on Thursday.
[Agitated]	PISCHIN.  What? Why to town? I see furniture... trunks.... Well, never mind. [Crying] Never mind. These Englishmen are men of immense intellect.... Never mind.... Be happy.... God will help you.... Never mind.... Everything in this world comes to an end.... [Kisses LUBOV ANDREYEVNA’S hand] And if you should happen to hear that my end has come, just remember this old... horse and say: “There was one such and such a Simeonov-Pischin, God bless his soul....” Wonderful weather... yes.... [Exit deeply moved, but returns at once and says in the door] Dashenka sent her love! [Exit.]
[Pause]	LUBOV. The second is Varya. She’s used to getting up early and to work, and now she’s no work to do she’s like a fish out of water. She’s grown thin and pale, and she cries, poor thing....  You know very well, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that I used to hope to marry her to you, and I suppose you are going to marry somebody? [Whispers to ANYA, who nods to CHARLOTTA, and they both go out] She loves you, she’s your sort, and I don’t understand, I really don’t, why you seem to be keeping away from each other. I don’t understand!
[Animated]	LUBOV.  Excellent. We’ll go out. Yasha, allez. I’ll call her in.... [At the door] Varya, leave that and come here. Come! [Exit with YASHA.]
[Pause.]	VARYA. I packed it myself and I don’t remember. 
[Pause]	LOPAKHIN. Is that at Yashnevo? It’s about fifty miles.  So life in this house is finished now....
[Pause]	VARYA. I didn’t look.  And our thermometer’s broken.... [Pause.]
[Pause]	LUBOV. Well?  We must go.
[Joyfully]	ANYA.  Away!
[Imploringly]	ANYA.  Uncle!
[Stupidly]	GAEV.  Double the red into the middle.... I’ll be quiet.
[Hoarsely]	EPIKHODOV.  You may depend upon me, Ermolai Alexeyevitch!
[Suspiciously]	YASHA.  What manners....
[Exit.]	LOPAKHIN. Till the spring, then! Come on... till we meet again! 
[Gaily]	ANYA’S VOICE.  Mother!
[Laughing]	SORIN. For some reason, my boy, country life doesn’t suit me, and I am sure I shall never get used to it. Last night I went to bed at ten and woke at nine this morning, feeling as if, from oversleep, my brain had stuck to my skull.  And yet I accidentally dropped off to sleep again after dinner, and feel utterly done up at this moment. It is like a nightmare.
[Laughing]	SORIN. I foresee that that dog is going to howl all night again. It is always this way in the country; I have never been able to live as I like here. I come down for a month’s holiday, to rest and all, and am plagued so by their nonsense that I long to escape after the first day.  I have always been glad to get away from this place, but I have been retired now, and this was the only place I had to come to. Willy-nilly, one must live somewhere.
[Laughing]	SORIN.  Does she, really?
[Listening]	TREPLIEFF.  I hear footsteps! [He embraces his uncle] I cannot live without her; even the sound of her footsteps is music to me. I am madly happy. [He goes quickly to meet NINA, who comes in at that moment] My enchantress! My girl of dreams!
[Excitedly]	NINA.  It can’t be that I am late? No, I am not late.
[Laughing]	NINA. I have been in a fever all day, I was so afraid my father would prevent my coming, but he and my stepmother have just gone driving. The sky is clear, the moon is rising. How I hurried to get here! How I urged my horse to go faster and faster!  I am _so_ glad to see you! [She shakes hands with SORIN.]
[Coldly]	TREPLIEFF.  I have never read any of them, so I can’t say.
[Sings]	DORN. 
[Sings]	DORN. 
[Sighing]	SHAMRAEFF.  Pashka Tchadin! There are none left like him. The stage is not what it was in his time. There were sturdy oaks growing on it then, where now but stumps remain.
[Whispers]	ARKADINA.  What decadent rubbish is this?
[Imploringly]	TREPLIEFF.  Mother!
[Embarrassed]	NINA. I am delighted to meet you.  I have read all your books.
[Loudly]	SHAMRAEFF.  Jacob, my man! Raise the curtain!
[Startled]	NINA.  No, no!
[Imploringly]	SORIN.  Don’t go!
[Impetuously]	TREPLIEFF.  Where is Nina?
[Sighing]	DORN.  Ah, youth, youth!
[Tenderly]	DORN. Oh, how excitable you all are! And how much love there is about this lake of spells!  But what can I do for you, my child? What? What?
[Crossly]	DORN.  Ho! Take some camomile tea.
[Sings]	DORN. 
[Imploringly]	PAULINA. He has sent the carriage horses into the fields too. These misunderstandings occur every day. If you only knew how they excite me! I am ill; see! I am trembling all over! I cannot endure his rough ways.  Eugene, my darling, my beloved, take me to you. Our time is short; we are no longer young; let us end deception and concealment, even though it is only at the end of our lives. [A pause.]
[Alone]	NINA.  How strange to see a famous actress weeping, and for such a trifle! Is it not strange, too, that a famous author should sit fishing all day? He is the idol of the public, the papers are full of him, his photograph is for sale everywhere, his works have been translated into many foreign languages, and yet he is overjoyed if he catches a couple of minnows. I always thought famous people were distant and proud; I thought they despised the common crowd which exalts riches and birth, and avenged themselves on it by dazzling it with the inextinguishable honour and glory of their fame. But here I see them weeping and playing cards and flying into passions like everybody else.
[Thoughtfully]	TRIGORIN. What sensations? I don’t believe it gives any.  Either you exaggerate my fame, or else, if it exists, all I can say is that one simply doesn’t feel fame in any way.
[Thoughtfully]	ARKADINA. He is a misery to me!  He might possibly enter the army.
[Decidedly]	ARKADINA. Yes, but--However, I think I might manage about his clothes, but I couldn’t let him go abroad. And no, I don’t think I can let him have his clothes even, now.  I have no money at present.
[Whistles]	SORIN.  Very well. Forgive me, darling; don’t be angry. You are a noble, generous woman!
[Weeping]	ARKADINA.  I really haven’t the money.
[Laughing]	SORIN.  Yes, exactly, and on one’s back at night. Thank you, I can walk alone.
[Tenderly]	ARKADINA.  Make your peace with him, too. Don’t fight with him. You surely won’t fight?
[Impatiently]	TRIGORIN.  Yes, yes. [In deep thought] Why do I hear a note of sadness that wrings my heart in this cry of a pure soul? If at any time you should have need of my life, come and take it. [To ARKADINA] Let us stay here one more day!
[Shuddering]	ARKADINA.  No, no! I am only an ordinary woman; you must not say such things to me. Do not torment me, Boris; you frighten me.
[Imploringly]	MEDVIEDENKO.  Do come, Masha. The baby must be hungry.
[Crossly]	PAULINA.  Be off, in God’s name!
[Apologetically]	MEDVIEDENKO.  How can I go home when they won’t give me a horse?
[Sings]	DORN.  “The moon swims in the sky to-night.”
[Laughing]	SORIN.  I didn’t try for that, it came of its own accord.
[Laughing]	SORIN.  Twenty-eight years!
[Angrily]	SHAMRAEFF.  A horse to go home with! [Sternly] You know the horses have just been to the station. I can’t send them out again.
[Thoughtfully]	TRIGORIN. Did I?  I don’t remember.
[Gaily]	ARKADINA.  Bravo! Bravo!
[Despairingly]	NINA.  Why, why does he talk to me like this?
[Weeping]	NINA. My carriage is at the gate. Do not come out to see me off. I shall find the way alone.  Let me have some water.
[Sadly]	TREPLIEFF.  You have found your way, you know where you are going, but I am still groping in a chaos of phantoms and dreams, not knowing whom and what end I am serving by it all. I do not believe in anything, and I do not know what my calling is.
[Listening]	NINA.  Hush! I must go. Good-bye. When I have become a famous actress you must come and see me. Will you promise to come? But now--[She takes his hand] it is late. I can hardly stand. I am fainting. I am hungry.
[Frightened]	ARKADINA.  What was that?
[orthodox]	To the irreverent--and which of us will claim entire exemption from that comfortable classification?--there is something very amusing in the attitude of the orthodox criticism toward Bernard Shaw. He so obviously disregards all the canons and unities and other things which every well-bred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthy of serious criticism . Indeed he knows no more about the dramatic art than, according to his own story in "The Man of Destiny," Napoleon at Tavazzano knew of the Art of War. But both men were successes each in his way--the latter won victories and the former gained audiences, in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war and the theatre. Shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have his characters make long speeches at one another, apparently thinking that this embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly of bombast and rhetoric. There never was an author who showed less predilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results. He recognized, early in his days, many things awry in the world and he assumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit. It seems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright. He began as an Essayist, but who reads essays now-a-days?--he then turned novelist with no better success, for no one would read such preposterous stuff as he chose to emit. He only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational men and women--although he has created few of the latter--can be most extremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking.
[Ecstatically]	RAINA. Tell me, tell me. How was it!  Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.)
[indignantly]	CATHERINE . Our ideas real! What do you mean?
[Quickly.]	RAINA. Our ideas of what Sergius would do--our patriotism--our heroic ideals. Oh, what faithless little creatures girls are!--I sometimes used to doubt whether they were anything but dreams. When I buckled on Sergius's sword he looked so noble: it was treason to think of disillusion or humiliation or failure. And yet--and yet-- Promise me you'll never tell him.
[Remorsefully.]	RAINA. Well, it came into my head just as he was holding me in his arms and looking into my eyes, that perhaps we only had our heroic ideas because we are so fond of reading Byron and Pushkin, and because we were so delighted with the opera that season at Bucharest. Real life is so seldom like that--indeed never, as far as I knew it then.  Only think, mother, I doubted him: I wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian officers.
[carelessly]	LOUKA . Good-night. (She goes out, swaggering.)
[disdainfully]	RAINA . I suppose not. (She draws herself up superbly, and looks him straight in the face, saying with emphasis) Some soldiers, I know, are afraid of death.
[cunningly]	MAN . Ah; but suppose I don't shoot you, what will happen then? Why, a lot of your cavalry--the greatest blackguards in your army--will burst into this pretty room of yours and slaughter me here like a pig; for I'll fight like a demon: they shan't get me into the street to amuse themselves with: I know what they are. Are you prepared to receive that sort of company in your present undress? (Raina, suddenly conscious of her nightgown, instinctively shrinks and gathers it more closely about her. He watches her, and adds, pitilessly) It's rather scanty, eh? (She turns to the ottoman. He raises his pistol instantly, and cries) Stop! (She stops.) Where are you going?
[revolted]	RAINA . It is not the weapon of a gentleman!
[anxiously]	RAINA . What will you do?
[grimly]	MAN . Never mind. Keep out of the way. It will not last long.
[impulsively]	RAINA . I'll help you. Hide yourself, oh, hide yourself, quick, behind the curtain. (She seizes him by a torn strip of his sleeve, and pulls him towards the window.)
[petulantly]	RAINA . Nonsense, sir, you can see that there is no one on the balcony. (She throws the shutters wide open and stands with her back to the curtain where the man is hidden, pointing to the moonlit balcony. A couple of shots are fired right under the window, and a bullet shatters the glass opposite Raina, who winks and gasps, but stands her ground, whilst Catherine screams, and the officer rushes to the balcony.)
[haughtily]	RAINA . No, you are one of the Austrians who set the Servians on to rob us of our national liberty, and who officer their army for them. We hate them!
[irritably]	MAN . Don't frighten me like that. What is it?
[ravenously]	MAN . You're an angel! (He gobbles the comfits.) Creams! Delicious! (He looks anxiously to see whether there are any more. There are none. He accepts the inevitable with pathetic goodhumor, and says, with grateful emotion) Bless you, dear lady. You can always tell an old soldier by the inside of his holsters and cartridge boxes. The young ones carry pistols and cartridges; the old ones, grub. Thank you. (He hands back the box. She snatches it contemptuously from him and throws it away. This impatient action is so sudden that he shies again.) Ugh! Don't do things so suddenly, gracious lady. Don't revenge yourself because I frightened you just now.
[superbly]	RAINA . Frighten me! Do you know, sir, that though I am only a woman, I think I am at heart as brave as you.
[quickly]	RAINA . No.
[Indignantly.]	MAN. Oh, yes, they are. There are only two sorts of soldiers: old ones and young ones. I've served fourteen years: half of your fellows never smelt powder before. Why, how is it that you've just beaten us? Sheer ignorance of the art of war, nothing else.  I never saw anything so unprofessional.
[ironically]	RAINA . Oh, was it unprofessional to beat you?
[prosaically]	MAN . Hm! you should see the poor devil pulling at his horse.
[goodhumoredly]	MAN . That's what you'd have said if you'd seen the first man in the charge to-day.
[breathless]	RAINA . Ah, I knew it! Tell me--tell me about him.
[quickly]	RAINA . Why do you laugh?
[sternly]	RAINA . Give me back the portrait, sir.
[turning]	MAN . How?
[coldly]	RAINA . Thank you. And now I will do a soldierly thing. You cannot stay here after what you have just said about my future husband; but I will go out on the balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street. (She turns to the window.)
[desperately]	RAINA . But what am I to do with you.
[anxiously]	RAINA . But if you fall?
[affectedly]	RAINA . I tell you these things to shew you that you are not in the house of ignorant country folk who would kill you the moment they saw your Servian uniform, but among civilized people. We go to Bucharest every year for the opera season; and I have spent a whole month in Vienna.
[contemptuously]	RAINA . No!
[touched]	RAINA . That is very nice of you. I see that you are a gentleman.
[puzzled]	MAN . Eh?
[severely]	RAINA . Will you please stand up while I am away. (He rises reluctantly.) All the time, mind.
[drowsily]	MAN . Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep, slee--(The words trail off into a murmur. He wakes again with a shock on the point of falling.) Where am I? That's what I want to know: where am I? Must keep awake. Nothing keeps me awake except danger--remember that--(intently) danger, danger, danger, dan-- Where's danger? Must find it. (He starts of vaguely around the room in search of it.) What am I looking for? Sleep--danger--don't know. (He stumbles against the bed.) Ah, yes: now I know. All right now. I'm to go to bed, but not to sleep--be sure not to sleep--because of danger. Not to lie down, either, only sit down. (He sits on the bed. A blissful expression comes into his face.) Ah! (With a happy sigh he sinks back at full length; lifts his boots into the bed with a final effort; and falls fast asleep instantly.)
[scandalized]	CATHERINE . Well! (She strides to the left side of the bed, Raina following and standing opposite her on the right.) He's fast asleep. The brute!
[anxiously]	RAINA . Sh!
[sedately]	NICOLA . I shall always be dependent on the good will of the family. When I leave their service and start a shop in Sofia, their custom will be half my capital: their bad word would ruin me.
[pityingly]	NICOLA . I should have expected more sense from you, Louka. But you're young, you're young!
[complacently]	NICOLA . Yes: that's the secret of success in service.
[quickly]	NICOLA . My word for it, Louka, the war's over. Off with you and get some fresh coffee. (He runs out into the stable yard.)
[submissively]	PETKOFF . My dear: they didn't consult me. What could _I_ do? (She sits down and turns away from him.) But of course we saw to it that the treaty was an honorable one. It declares peace--
[outraged]	CATHERINE . Peace!
[relenting]	CATHERINE . Ah! (Stretches her hand affectionately across the table to squeeze his.)
[Shouting.]	PETKOFF. There's Sergius.  Hollo, Nicola!
[drily]	PETKOFF . Mother-in-law, Sergius; mother-in-law! Sit down, and have some coffee.
[vexed]	PETKOFF . Now who could have supposed you were going to do such a thing?
[impatiently]	CATHERINE . Yes: she listens for it. It is an abominable habit.
[Chuckling.]	PETKOFF. A volunteer of course--keen on picking up his profession.  We shouldn't have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadn't shewn us how to do it: we knew nothing about it; and neither did the Servians. Egad, there'd have been no war without them.
[grinning]	PETKOFF . Sergius: tell Catherine that queer story his friend told us about him--how he escaped after Slivnitza. You remember?--about his being hid by two women.
[ashamed]	SERGIUS . No, Petkoff: I was wrong. (To Raina, with earnest humility.) I beg your pardon. I have behaved abominably. Forgive me, Raina. (She bows reservedly.) And you, too, madam. (Catherine bows graciously and sits down. He proceeds solemnly, again addressing Raina.) The glimpses I have had of the seamy side of life during the last few months have made me cynical; but I should not have brought my cynicism here--least of all into your presence, Raina. I--(Here, turning to the others, he is evidently about to begin a long speech when the Major interrupts him.)
[protesting]	SERGIUS . My dear madam, impossible: you--
[astonished]	LOUKA . No, sir.
[innocently]	LOUKA . Perhaps you would like some coffee, sir? (She stretches her hand across the table for the coffee pot.)
[complaining]	LOUKA . I may have been seen from the windows: Miss Raina is sure to be spying about after you.
[demurely]	LOUKA . Not for the world, sir, I'm sure. May I go on with my work please, now?
[charmed]	SERGIUS . Witty as well as pretty. (He tries to kiss her.)
[retreating]	LOUKA . Oh, I mean no harm: you've no right to take up my words like that. The mistress knows all about it. And I tell you that if that gentleman ever comes here again, Miss Raina will marry him, whether he likes it or not. I know the difference between the sort of manner you and she put on before one another and the real manner. (Sergius shivers as if she had stabbed him. Then, setting his face like iron, he strides grimly to her, and grips her above the elbows with both bands.)
[wincing]	LOUKA . Not so tight: you're hurting me!
[writhing]	LOUKA . Please--
[Gaily.]	RAINA. I'm ready! What's the matter?  Have you been flirting with Louka?
[hastily]	SERGIUS . No, no. How can you think such a thing?
[disappointed]	RAINA . But we are just going out for a walk.
[laughing]	SERGIUS . Very well. (He goes in. Raina watches him until he is out of her sight. Then, with a perceptible relaxation of manner, she begins to pace up and down about the garden in a brown study.)
[flaming]	CATHERINE . A Servian! How dare he--(Checking herself bitterly.) Oh, I forgot. We are at peace now. I suppose we shall have them calling every day to pay their compliments. Well, if he is an officer why don't you tell your master? He is in the library with Major Saranoff. Why do you come to me?
[reading]	CATHERINE . "Captain Bluntschli!" That's a German name.
[timidly]	LOUKA . He has a big carpet bag, madam.
[decisively]	CATHERINE . Bring the gentleman out here at once. (Imperatively.) And be very polite to him. Don't delay. Here (impatiently snatching the salver from her): leave that here; and go straight back to him.
[Going.]	LOUKA. Yes, madam. 
[stopping]	LOUKA . Yes, madam.
[Going.]	LOUKA. Yes, madam. 
[surprised]	LOUKA . His bag?
[Vehemently.]	CATHERINE. Yes, here, as soon as possible.  Be quick! (Louka runs into the house. Catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush. She then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror, with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron. A touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) Oh, how--how--how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select! (Louka appears at the door of the house, announcing "Captain Bluntschli;" and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again. He is the man of the adventure in Raina's room. He is now clean, well brushed, smartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still unmistakably the same man. The moment Louka's back is turned, Catherine swoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.) Captain Bluntschli, I am very glad to see you; but you must leave this house at once. (He raises his eyebrows.) My husband has just returned, with my future son-in-law; and they know nothing. If they did, the consequences would be terrible. You are a foreigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. We still hate the Servians: the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey. If he discovered our secret, he would never forgive me; and my daughter's life would hardly be safe. Will you, like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before he finds you here?
[sardonically]	SERGIUS . Impossible, Bluntschli. We want you here badly. We have to send on three cavalry regiments to Phillipopolis; and we don't in the least know how to do it.
[eagerly]	PETKOFF . Yes, that's it. (To Sergius.) He sees the whole thing at once.
[laughing]	BLUNTSCHLI . I assure you I did. (Stealing a whimsical glance at her.) Your explanation was a relief.
[testily]	PETKOFF . And has Nicola taken to drinking? He used to be careful enough. First he shews Captain Bluntschli out here when he knew quite well I was in the--hum!--library; and then he goes downstairs and breaks Raina's chocolate soldier. He must--(At this moment Nicola appears at the top of the steps R., with a carpet bag. He descends; places it respectfully before Bluntschli; and waits for further orders. General amazement. Nicola, unconscious of the effect he is producing, looks perfectly satisfied with himself. When Petkoff recovers his power of speech, he breaks out at him with) Are you mad, Nicola?
[muttering]	PETKOFF . Scoundrel. He's got out of hand while I was away. I'll teach him. (Recollecting his guest.) Oh, well, never mind. Come, Bluntschli, lets have no more nonsense about you having to go away. You know very well you're not going back to Switzerland yet. Until you do go back you'll stay with us.
[appealingly]	CATHERINE. Of course I shall be only too delighted if  Captain Bluntschli really wishes to stay. He knows my wishes.
[cordially]	SERGIUS . That settles it!
[heartily]	PETKOFF . Of course!
[smiling]	BLUNTSCHLI . Well, If I must, I must! (Gesture of despair from Catherine.)
[grimly]	SERGIUS . Yes: we'll manage it. He finds out what to do; draws up the orders; and I sign 'em. Division of labour, Major. (Bluntschli passes him a paper.) Another one? Thank you. (He plants the papers squarely before him; sets his chair carefully parallel to them; and signs with the air of a man resolutely performing a difficult and dangerous feat.) This hand is more accustomed to the sword than to the pen.
[imperturbably]	BLUNTSCHLI . It would be robbing you, Major. Madame is sure to be right. (Without looking up, he passes another batch of papers to Sergius.)
[eagerly]	PETKOFF . Your best char--
[confidentially]	BLUNTSCHLI . Just see that he talks to them properly, Major, will you?
[officiously]	PETKOFF . Quite right, Bluntschli, quite right. I'll see to it. (He goes to the door importantly, but hesitates on the threshold.) By the bye, Catherine, you may as well come, too. They'll be far more frightened of you than of me.
[sceptically]	BLUNTSCHLI . You mean that you wouldn't like him to find out that the story about the ice pudding was a--a--a--You know.
[wincing]	RAINA . Ah, don't talk of it in that flippant way. I lied: I know it. But I did it to save your life. He would have killed you. That was the second time I ever uttered a falsehood. (Bluntschli rises quickly and looks doubtfully and somewhat severely at her.) Do you remember the first time?
[dubiously]	BLUNTSCHLI . There's reason in everything. You said you'd told only two lies in your whole life. Dear young lady: isn't that rather a short allowance? I'm quite a straightforward man myself; but it wouldn't last me a whole morning.
[superbly]	RAINA . Captain Bluntschli!
[unmoved]	BLUNTSCHLI . Yes?
[gasping]	RAINA . I! I!!! (She points to herself incredulously, meaning "I, Raina Petkoff, tell lies!" He meets her gaze unflinchingly. She suddenly sits down beside him, and adds, with a complete change of manner from the heroic to the familiar) How did you find me out?
[promptly]	BLUNTSCHLI . Instinct, dear young lady. Instinct, and experience of the world.
[wonderingly]	RAINA . Do you know, you are the first man I ever met who did not take me seriously?
[startled]	RAINA . Do you think so?
[Discouraged.]	RAINA. I wonder--I wonder is he? If I thought that--!  Ah, well, what does it matter? I suppose, now that you've found me out, you despise me.
[pleased]	RAINA . Really?
[astonished]	BLUNTSCHLI . Your portrait! You never gave me your portrait.
[quickly]	RAINA . Do you mean to say you never got it?
[indignantly]	RAINA . I did not send it to you. (She turns her head away, and adds, reluctantly.) It was in the pocket of that coat.
[impatiently]	RAINA . Yes, that is so clever--so clever! What shall I do?
[phlegmatically]	BLUNTSCHLI . That's the Swiss national character, dear lady.
[timidly]	RAINA . Nine thousand hotels?
[tauntingly]	LOUKA . He has not much heart, that Swiss, though he is so fond of the Servians. He has not a word of grief for his poor father.
[bitterly]	RAINA . Grief!--a man who has been doing nothing but killing people for years! What does he care? What does any soldier care? (She goes to the door, evidently restraining her tears with difficulty.)
[proudly]	LOUKA . My own fashion.
[scornfully]	LOUKA . Yes: sell your manhood for thirty levas, and buy me for ten! Keep your money. You were born to be a servant. I was not. When you set up your shop you will only be everybody's servant instead of somebody's servant.
[masterfully]	SERGIUS . Quite sure? (He makes a movement as if to take her in his arms.)
[wistfully]	LOUKA . I wish I could believe a man could be so unlike a woman as that. I wonder are you really a brave man?
[ironically]	SERGIUS . Indeed! I am willing to be instructed.
[recoiling]	SERGIUS . The Swiss!
[tormentedly]	SERGIUS . Do you think I believe that she--she! whose worst thoughts are higher than your best ones, is capable of trifling with another man behind my back?
[quietly]	LOUKA . What does that mean--an insult?
[commandingly]	SERGIUS . It means that you love me, and that I have had you here in my arms, and will perhaps have you there again. Whether that is an insult I neither know nor care: take it as you please. But (vehemently) I will not be a coward and a trifler. If I choose to love you, I dare marry you, in spite of all Bulgaria. If these hands ever touch you again, they shall touch my affianced bride.
[warmly]	BLUNTSCHLI . Pooh! don't talk to me about Bulgaria. You don't know what fighting is. But have it your own way. Bring your sabre along. I'll meet you.
[haughtily]	RAINA . What do you mean?
[scandalized]	RAINA . Sergius!
[passionately]	RAINA . This is the doing of that friend of yours, Captain Bluntschli. It is he who is spreading this horrible story about me. (She walks about excitedly.)
[outraged]	RAINA . Like love! You say that before me.
[cynically]	SERGIUS . Raina: our romance is shattered. Life's a farce.
[apologetically]	BLUNTSCHLI . Quite true, quite true. I always was that sort of chap. I'm very sorry. But now that you've found that life isn't a farce, but something quite sensible and serious, what further obstacle is there to your happiness?
[riling]	RAINA . You are very solicitous about my happiness and his. Do you forget his new love--Louka? It is not you that he must fight now, but his rival, Nicola.
[sarcastically]	RAINA . A shocking sacrifice, isn't it? Such beauty, such intellect, such modesty, wasted on a middle-aged servant man! Really, Sergius, you cannot stand by and allow such a thing. It would be unworthy of your chivalry.
[interrupting]	RAINA . Do you deny that you were making love to her when she told you?
[blushing]	BLUNTSCHLI . Not at all, I assure you. I'm only very glad to get you two quieted. There now, let's be pleasant and talk it over in a friendly way. Where is this other young lady?
[contemptuously]	RAINA . Your love! Your curiosity, you mean.
[fiercely]	LOUKA . It means--
[genially]	PETKOFF . That's all right. (He sneezes.) Go and ask your mistress for my coat, like a good girl, will you? (She turns to obey; but Nicola enters with the coat; and she makes a pretence of having business in the room by taking the little table with the hookah away to the wall near the windows.)
[Shouting]	PETKOFF. Your photograph, with the inscription: "Raina, to her Chocolate Cream Soldier--a souvenir." Now you know there's something more in this than meets the eye; and I'm going to find it out.  Nicola!
[enigmatically]	SERGIUS . The world is not such an innocent place as we used to think, Petkoff.
[rising]	BLUNTSCHLI . It's all right, Major. I'm the chocolate cream soldier. (Petkoff and Sergius are equally astonished.) The gracious young lady saved my life by giving me chocolate creams when I was starving--shall I ever forget their flavour! My late friend Stolz told you the story at Peerot. I was the fugitive.
[bitterly]	RAINA . Major Saranoff has changed his mind. And when I wrote that on the photograph, I did not know that Captain Bluntschli was married.
[exasperated]	PETKOFF . Raina: will you kindly inform me, if I am not asking too much, which gentleman you are engaged to?
[approvingly]	SERGIUS . You are right. (He bends his knee in his grandest manner.) Forgive me!
[coldly]	LOUKA . You can withdraw if you like.
[threateningly]	CATHERINE . Louka: you have been telling stories.
[haughtily]	CATHERINE . Raina! (Raina is equally indignant at the liberty.)
[surprised]	BLUNTSCHLI . Hallo!
[promptly]	BLUNTSCHLI . An incurably romantic disposition. I ran away from home twice when I was a boy. I went into the army instead of into my father's business. I climbed the balcony of this house when a man of sense would have dived into the nearest cellar. I came sneaking back here to have another look at the young lady when any other man of my age would have sent the coat back--
[stupefied]	BLUNTSCHLI . Twenty-three! (She snaps the photograph contemptuously from his hand; tears it across; and throws the pieces at his feet.)
[overwhelmed]	BLUNTSCHLI . Twenty-three! Twenty-three!! (He considers.) Hm! (Swiftly making up his mind.) In that case, Major Petkoff, I beg to propose formally to become a suitor for your daughter's hand, in place of Major Saranoff retired.
[severely]	CATHERINE . My daughter, sir, is accustomed to a first-rate stable.

[Impatiently]	PROSERPINE. Guild of St. Matthew on Monday. Independent Labor Party, Greenwich Branch, on Thursday. Monday, Social-Democratic Federation, Mile End Branch. Thursday, first Confirmation class-- . Oh, I'd better tell them you can't come. They're only half a dozen ignorant and conceited costermongers without five shillings between them.
[amused]	MORELL . Ah; but you see they're near relatives of mine, Miss Garnett.
[relieved]	PROSERPINE . Oh, is that all?
[sharply]	PROSERPINE . Miss Garnett, if you please.
[perplexed]	LEXY . Is she in earnest, Morell?
[heartily]	MORELL . Ha! ha! Don't I? I'm going to have this day all to myself--or at least the forenoon. My wife's coming back: she's due here at 11.45.
[surprised]	LEXY . Coming back already--with the children? I thought they were to stay to the end of the month.
[anxiously]	LEXY . But, my dear Morell, if what Jimmy and Fluffy had was scarlatina, do you think it wise--
[tenderly]	MORELL . Ah, my boy, get married--get married to a good woman; and then you'll understand. That's a foretaste of what will be best in the Kingdom of Heaven we are trying to establish on earth. That will cure you of dawdling. An honest man feels that he must pay Heaven for every hour of happiness with a good spell of hard, unselfish work to make others happy. We have no more right to consume happiness without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it. Get a wife like my Candida; and you'll always be in arrear with your repayment. (He pats Lexy affectionately on the back, and is leaving the room when Lexy calls to him.)
[earnestly]	LEXY . No, sir, really.
[thoughtfully]	MORELL . Hm! Time for him to take another look at Candida before she grows out of his knowledge. (He resigns himself to the inevitable, and goes out. Lexy looks after him with beaming, foolish worship.)
[shocked]	LEXY . Oh, Miss Prossy!
[indignantly]	PROSERPINE . I have no feeling against her. She's very nice, very good-hearted: I'm very fond of her and can appreciate her real qualities far better than any man can. (He shakes his head sadly and turns to the bookcase, looking along the shelves for a volume. She follows him with intense pepperiness.) You don't believe me? (He turns and faces her. She pounces at him with spitfire energy.) You think I'm jealous. Oh, what a profound knowledge of the human heart you have, Mr. Lexy Mill! How well you know the weaknesses of Woman, don't you? It must be so nice to be a man and have a fine penetrating intellect instead of mere emotions like us, and to know that the reason we don't share your amorous delusions is that we're all jealous of one another! (She abandons him with a toss of her shoulders, and crosses to the fire to warm her hands.)
[stung]	LEXY . I try to follow his example, not to imitate him.
[rising]	PROSERPINE . He's upstairs. I'll fetch him for you.
[assenting]	BURGESS . No: she was younger. (Miss Garnett stolidly stares at him; then goes out with great dignity. He receives this quite obtusely, and crosses to the hearth-rug, where he turns and spreads himself with his back to the fire.) Startin' on your rounds, Mr. Mill?
[momentously]	BURGESS . Don't let me detain you, Mr. Mill. What I come about is private between me and Mr. Morell.
[huffily]	LEXY . I have no intention of intruding, I am sure, Mr. Burgess. Good morning.
[patronizingly]	BURGESS . Oh, good morning to you. (Morell returns as Lexy is making for the door.)
[soothingly]	BURGESS . Well, perhaps I did; but (with conciliatory cheerfulness) I meant no offence by it. A clergyman is privileged to be a bit of a fool, you know: it's on'y becomin' in his profession that he should. Anyhow, I come here, not to rake up hold differences, but to let bygones be bygones. (Suddenly becoming very solemn, and approaching Morell.) James: three year ago, you done me a hill turn. You done me hout of a contrac'; an' when I gev you 'arsh words in my nat'ral disappointment, you turned my daughrter again me. Well, I've come to act the part of a Cherischin. (Offering his hand.) I forgive you, James.
[hotly]	MORELL . No, sir, it is not becoming language for a clergyman. I used the wrong word. I should have said damn your impudence: that's what St. Paul, or any honest priest would have said to you. Do you think I have forgotten that tender of yours for the contract to supply clothing to the workhouse?
[triumphantly]	BURGESS . Yes.
[unctuously]	BURGESS . I've turned a moddle hemployer. I don't hemploy no women now: they're all sacked; and the work is done by machinery. Not a man 'as less than sixpence a hour; and the skilled 'ands gits the Trade Union rate. (Proudly.) What 'ave you to say to me now?
[overwhelmed]	MORELL . Is it possible! Well, there's more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth-- (Going to Burgess with an explosion of apologetic cordiality.) My dear Burgess, I most heartily beg your pardon for my hard thoughts of you. (Grasps his hand.) And now, don't you feel the better for the change? Come, confess, you're happier. You look happier.
[ruefully]	BURGESS . Well, p'raps I do. I s'pose I must, since you notice it. At all events, I git my contrax asseppit (accepted) by the County Council. (Savagely.) They dussent'ave nothink to do with me unless I paid fair wages--curse 'em for a parcel o' meddlin' fools!
[obstinately]	BURGESS . Yes, I ham--just family sentiment and nothink else.
[unmoved]	MORELL . I'll say it just as often as may be necessary to convince you that it's true. I don't believe you.
[coaxingly]	BURGESS . No, I didn't, James. I--
[portentously]	BURGESS . Yes, times 'as changed mor'n I could a believed. Five yorr (year) ago, no sensible man would a thought o' takin' up with your ideas. I hused to wonder you was let preach at all. Why, I know a clorgyman that 'as bin kep' hout of his job for yorrs by the Bishop of London, although the pore feller's not a bit more religious than you are. But to-day, if henyone was to offer to bet me a thousan' poun' that you'll end by bein' a bishop yourself, I shouldn't venture to take the bet. You and yore crew are gettin' hinfluential: I can see that. They'll 'ave to give you something someday, if it's only to stop yore mouth. You 'ad the right instinc' arter all, James: the line you took is the payin' line in the long run fur a man o' your sort.
[impetuously]	MORELL . Oh, bother your understanding! You've kept me late for Candida. (With compassionate fervor.) My poor love: how did you manage about the luggage?--how--
[pleased]	MORELL . Eugene!
[incredulously]	BURGESS . Garn! D'you mean to tell me--your hown father!--that cab touts or such like, orf the Embankment, buys pictur's like that? (Severely.) Don't deceive me, Candy: it's a 'Igh Church pictur; and James chose it hisself.
[Sarcastically.]	BURGESS. Then wot is he?  A nobleman, I 'spose.
[delighted--nodding]	CANDIDA . Yes. His uncle's a peer--a real live earl.
[laughing]	CANDIDA . Well, Eugene. (He turns with a start and comes eagerly towards her, but stops irresolutely as he meets her amused look.) What do you think of my father?
[touched]	CANDIDA . Do you know, you are a very nice boy, Eugene, with all your queerness. If you had laughed at my father I shouldn't have minded; but I like you ever so much better for being nice to him.
[scared]	MARCHBANKS . I mustn't. (He glances quickly at Morell, but at once avoids his frank look, and adds, with obvious disingenuousness) I can't.
[earnestly]	MARCHBANKS . No: I should like to, indeed. Thank you very much. But--but--
[Plaintively.]	MARCHBANKS. Thank you, I should like that very much. But I really mustn't. The truth is, Mrs. Morell told me not to. She said she didn't think you'd ask me to stay to lunch, but that I was to remember, if you did, that you didn't really want me to.  She said I'd understand; but I don't. Please don't tell her I told you.
[drolly]	MORELL . Oh, is that all? Won't my suggestion that you should take a turn in the park meet the difficulty?
[buoyantly]	MORELL . I know it, my lad. La Rochefoucauld said that there are convenient marriages, but no delightful ones. You don't know the comfort of seeing through and through a thundering liar and rotten cynic like that fellow. Ha, ha! Now off with you to the park, and write your poem. Half past one, sharp, mind: we never wait for anybody.
[wildly]	MARCHBANKS . No: stop: you shan't. I'll force it into the light.
[puzzled]	MORELL . Eh? Force what?
[passionately]	MARCHBANKS . Now. Before you leave this room. (He retreats a few steps, and stands as if to bar Morell's way to the door.)
[vehemently]	MARCHBANKS . YOU dare say that of her! You think that way of the love she inspires! It is an insult to her!
[philosophically]	MORELL . She seems to bear it pretty well. (Looking him straight in the face.) Eugene, my boy: you are making a fool of yourself--a very great fool of yourself. There's a piece of wholesome plain speaking for you.
[ruthlessly]	MARCHBANKS . I know. I'm doing it on purpose. I told you I should stagger you.
[Stung]	MORELL . Marchbanks: you make it hard for me to control myself. My talent is like yours insofar as it has any real worth at all. It is the gift of finding words for divine truth.
[impetuously]	MARCHBANKS . It's the gift of the gab, nothing more and nothing less. What has your knack of fine talking to do with the truth, any more than playing the organ has? I've never been in your church; but I've been to your political meetings; and I've seen you do what's called rousing the meeting to enthusiasm: that is, you excited them until they behaved exactly as if they were drunk. And their wives looked on and saw clearly enough what fools they were. Oh, it's an old story: you'll find it in the Bible. I imagine King David, in his fits of enthusiasm, was very like you. (Stabbing him with the words.) "But his wife despised him in her heart."
[wrathfully]	MORELL . Leave my house. Do you hear? (He advances on him threateningly.)
[temporizing]	MORELL . Marchbanks: it is sometimes justifiable.
[shortly]	MORELL . Oh, yes, certainly: he had better. (He goes to the table and pretends to busy himself with his papers there.)
[timidly]	MARCHBANKS . I'm very sorry, Miss Garnett. I only tried to make it write.
[earnestly]	MARCHBANKS . I assure you I didn't touch the keys. I didn't, indeed. I only turned a little wheel. (He points irresolutely at the tension wheel.)
[seriously]	MARCHBANKS . I suppose a machine could be made to write love-letters. They're all the same, aren't they!
[simply]	MARCHBANKS . Really! Oh, then you are shy, like me. Isn't that so?
[secretly]	MARCHBANKS . You must be: that is the reason there are so few love affairs in the world. We all go about longing for love: it is the first need of our natures, the loudest cry Of our hearts; but we dare not utter our longing: we are too shy. (Very earnestly.) Oh, Miss Garnett, what would you not give to be without fear, without shame--
[scandalized]	PROSERPINE , Well, upon my word!
[hopelessly]	MARCHBANKS . Nothing that's worth saying IS proper. (He rises, and wanders about the room in his lost way, saying) I can't understand you, Miss Garnett. What am I to talk about?
[compassionately]	MARCHBANKS . Yes, I know. And so you haven't the courage to tell him?
[recoiling]	MARCHBANKS . No, really--I'm very sorry; but you mustn't think of that. I--
[exasperated]	PROSERPINE . Anybody that offered! No, I do not. What do you take me for?
[discouraged]	MARCHBANKS . No use. You won't make me REAL answers--only those things that everybody says. (He strays to the sofa and sits down disconsolately.)
[reddening]	PROSERPINE . What do you understand?
[passionately]	MARCHBANKS . No, answer me. I want to know: I MUST know. I can't understand it. I can see nothing in him but words, pious resolutions, what people call goodness. You can't love that.
[vehemently]	MARCHBANKS . You do. You lie--
[fretfully]	PROSERPINE . It's well you and I are not ladies and gentlemen: I'd talk to you pretty straight if Mr. Marchbanks wasn't here. (She pulls the letter out of the machine so crossly that it tears.) There, now I've spoiled this letter--have to be done all over again. Oh, I can't contain myself--silly old fathead!
[impressively]	BURGESS . No more you wouldn't. That's the danger in it. Well, he's mad.
[beginning]	MARCHBANKS . But surely that is only because his opinions--
[tormentedly]	MARCHBANKS . Do you think every woman is as coarse-grained as Miss Garnett?
[emphatically]	BURGESS . That's quite right, Mr. Morchbanks. That's quite right. She IS corse-grained.
[shocked]	BURGESS . What! Got the 'orrors, Mr. Morchbanks! Oh, that's bad, at your age. You must leave it off grajally.
[reassured]	CANDIDA . Nonsense, papa. It's only poetic horror, isn't it, Eugene? (Petting him.)
[abashed]	BURGESS . Oh, poetic 'orror, is it? I beg your pordon, I'm shore. (He turns to the fire again, deprecating his hasty conclusion.)
[harshly]	MORELL . And where there is nothing to do but to be idle, selfish and useless.
[jarred]	CANDIDA . Oh, James, how could you spoil it all!
[quaintly]	CANDIDA . He cleans the boots, Eugene. You will have to clean them to-morrow for saying that about him.
[scandalized]	BURGESS . Come, Candy, don't be vulgar. Mr. Morchbanks ain't accustomed to it. You're givin' him the 'orrors again. I mean the poetic ones.
[convulsively]	MARCHBANKS . Onions!
[sentimentally]	BURGESS . He talks very pretty. I allus had a turn for a bit of potery. Candy takes arter me that-a-way: huse ter make me tell her fairy stories when she was on'y a little kiddy not that 'igh (indicating a stature of two feet or thereabouts).
[preoccupied]	MORELL . Ah, indeed. (He blots the telegram, and goes out.)
[calmly]	PROSERPINE . I should never have supposed you had it in you. By the way, I'd better warn you, since you've taken such a fancy to Mr. Marchbanks. He's mad.
[loftily]	BURGESS . Don't you address no remarks to me. Tell your hemployer that I've gone into the garden for a smoke.
[mocking]	PROSERPINE . Oh!
[sentimentally]	BURGESS . Goin' for a turn in the garden to smoke, James.
[brusquely]	MORELL . Oh, all right, all right. (Burgess goes out pathetically in the character of the weary old man. Morell stands at the table, turning over his papers, and adding, across to Proserpine, half humorously, half absently) Well, Miss Prossy, why have you been calling my father-in-law names?
[shortly]	MORELL . Ha! No doubt. (He begins writing again.)
[shocked]	MORELL . Candida!
[incredulously]	MORELL . What! Of Prossy?
[laughing]	CANDIDA . No, no, no, no. Not jealous of anybody. Jealous for somebody else, who is not loved as he ought to be.
[startled]	MORELL . Eugene!
[hastily]	MORELL . Not at all. (Looking at her with troubled intensity.) You know that I have perfect confidence in you, Candida.
[grimly]	MORELL . Oh, he has no suspicion of it himself, hasn't he?
[dubiously]	CANDIDA . That will depend.
[bewildered]	MORELL . Depend!
[explaining]	CANDIDA . If he learns it from a good woman, then it will be all right: he will forgive me.
[delighted]	CANDIDA . He is always right. He understands you; he understands me; he understands Prossy; and you, James--you understand nothing. (She laughs, and kisses him to console him. He recoils as if stung, and springs up.)
[amazed]	CANDIDA . James!
[earnestly]	MARCHBANKS . Oh, stop, stop: I don't mean myself. You have made him suffer frightfully. I feel his pain in my own heart. I know that it is not your fault--it is something that must happen; but don't make light of it. I shudder when you torture him and laugh.
[incredulously]	CANDIDA . I torture James! Nonsense, Eugene: how you exaggerate! Silly! (She looks round at Morell, who hastily resumes his writing. She goes to him and stands behind his chair, bending over him.) Don't work any more, dear. Come and talk to us.
[promptly]	MORELL . Well, an excellent man. What better do they want?
[coaxingly]	CANDIDA . Oh, DO go, James. We'll all go.
[grumbling]	BURGESS . Look 'ere, Candy! I say! Let's stay at home by the fire, comfortable. He won't need to be more'n a couple-o'-hour away.
[terrified]	EUGENE . Oh, please don't let us go on the platform. No--everyone will stare at us--I couldn't. I'll sit at the back of the room.
[gaily]	CANDIDA . Yes.
[mystified]	BURGESS . Prossy's complaint. Wot are you talking about, James?
[confidentially]	LEXY . Well, I don't exactly know; but she spoke very strangely to me this morning. I'm afraid she's a little out of her mind sometimes.
[overwhelmed]	BURGESS . Why, it must be catchin'! Four in the same 'ouse! (He goes back to the hearth, quite lost before the instability of the human intellect in a clergyman's house.)
[surprised]	PROSERPINE . Don't they expect you?
[peremptorily]	MORELL . Do as I tell you.
[authoritatively]	MORELL . I insist. You do not want to come; and he does not want to come. (Candida is about to protest.) Oh, don't concern yourselves: I shall have plenty of people without you: your chairs will be wanted by unconverted people who have never heard me before.
[troubled]	CANDIDA . Eugene: wouldn't you like to come?
[starting]	CANDIDA . Eh?
[remorsefully]	CANDIDA . I'm so sorry, Eugene. I think the poker must have fascinated me. (She puts it down.)
[wondering]	CANDIDA . What? (With a puzzled glance at him.) I can't quite follow that. Those sonnets of yours have perfectly addled me. Why should there be a sword between us?
[evasively]	MARCHBANKS . Oh, never mind. (He stoops to pick up the manuscript.)
[involuntarily]	MORELL . Candida?
[Fiercely.]	MORELL. Well?  Speak, man: have you no feeling for me?
[triumphantly]	MORELL . She repulsed you!
[meaningly]	MORELL . Perhaps because I was not interrupted at the end of ten minutes.
[starting]	MORELL . A beggar dying of cold--asking for her shawl?
[excitedly]	MORELL . And she refused. Shall I tell you why she refused? I CAN tell you, on her own authority. It was because of--
[oddly]	MARCHBANKS . James and I are having a preaching match; and he is getting the worst of it. (Candida looks quickly round at Morell. Seeing that he is distressed, she hurries down to him, greatly vexed, speaking with vigorous reproach to Marchbanks.)
[appalled]	MARCHBANKS . Nothing--
[piteously]	MARCHBANKS . I mean--I--I'm very sorry. I won't do it again: indeed I won't. I'll let him alone.
[severely]	CANDIDA . Yes, I am--very angry. I have a great mind to pack you out of the house.
[Vehemently.]	CANDIDA. Oh, you needn't go: I can't turn you out at this time of night.  Shame on you! For shame!
[desperately]	MARCHBANKS . But what have I done?
[contemptuously]	MORELL . No.
[indignant]	MARCHBANKS . Oh!
[exhilaratedly]	MILL . Morell: I MUST congratulate you. (Grasping his hand.) What a noble, splendid, inspired address you gave us! You surpassed yourself.
[worriedly]	PROSERPINE . Oh, I wasn't minding you: I was trying to make notes. (She takes out her note-book, and looks at her stenography, which nearly makes her cry.)
[soothingly]	MORELL . Oh, well, well, never mind, never mind, never mind. Have you all had supper?
[surprised]	MORELL . A champagne supper! That was very handsome. Was it my eloquence that produced all this extravagance?
[rhetorically]	MILL . Your eloquence, and Mr. Burgess's goodness of heart. (With a fresh burst of exhilaration.) And what a very fine fellow the chairman is, Morell! He came to supper with us.
[stubbornly]	PROSERPINE . Yes, I do. I'm only a beer teetotaller, not a champagne teetotaller. I don't like beer. Are there any letters for me to answer, Mr. Morell?
[gallantly]	LEXY . Had I not better see you home, Miss Garnett?
[indignantly]	BURGESS . Stuff, indeed! That gurl dunno wot champagne is! Pommery and Greeno at twelve and six a bottle. She took two glasses a'most straight hoff.
[alarmed]	LEXY . But if she should really be--Suppose she began to sing in the street, or anything of that sort.
[affrightedly]	MARCHBANKS . Yes: I'd better go. .(He hurries across to the door; but Candida places herself before it, barring his way.)
[quailing]	MARCHBANKS . No: I--I didn't mean to. (He comes back into the room and sits down abjectly on the sofa.)
[earnestly]	MARCHBANKS . Yes, heartbroken.
[discouraged]	MARCHBANKS . Morell: she's laughing at us.
[whispering]	MARCHBANKS . Stop Morell. Don't let us say anything.
[quietly]	CANDIDA . Tell him, James.
[slowly]	MORELL . I meant to prepare your mind carefully, Candida, so as to prevent misunderstanding.
[baldly]	MORELL . Eugene declares that you are in love with him.
[frantically]	MARCHBANKS . No, no, no, no, never. I did not, Mrs. Morell: it's not true. I said I loved you, and that he didn't. I said that I understood you, and that he couldn't. And it was not after what passed there before the fire that I spoke: it was not, on my word. It was this morning.
[enlightened]	CANDIDA . This morning!
[ashamed]	MORELL . You know, Candida, that I have a temper to struggle with. And he said (shuddering) that you despised me in your heart.
[terrified]	MARCHBANKS . No!
[severely]	CANDIDA . Then James has just told me a falsehood. Is that what you mean?
[interjecting]	CANDIDA . Try!
[continuing]	MORELL . Eugene was right. As you told me a few hours after, he is always right. He said nothing that you did not say far better yourself. He is the poet, who sees everything; and I am the poor parson, who understands nothing.
[remorsefully]	CANDIDA . Do you mind what is said by a foolish boy, because I said something like it again in jest?
[firmly]	MORELL . Quite. You must choose definitely.
[anxiously]	MARCHBANKS . Morell: you don't understand. She means that she belongs to herself.
[reproachfully]	MORELL . Cand-- (He breaks down: his eyes and throat fill with tears: the orator becomes the wounded animal.) I can't speak--
[impressed]	CANDIDA . That's a good bid, Eugene. Now I know how to make my choice.
[significantly]	CANDIDA . I give myself to the weaker of the two.

[astonished]	LADY BRITOMART  Nonsense! [With some remorse] My poor boy, did you think I was angry with you?
[amazed]	STEPHEN  Only a--
[troubled]	STEPHEN  I have thought sometimes that perhaps I ought; but really, mother, I know so little about them; and what I do know is so painful--it is so impossible to mention some things to you--[he stops, ashamed].
[complacently]	LADY BRITOMART  Yes: I have made a very good match for Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is ten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under the terms of his father's will allow him more than 800 pounds a year.
[ashamed]	STEPHEN  Do you mean for--for--for--
[desperately]	STEPHEN  I daresay we have been the very imperfect children of a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me alone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son.
[amazed]	LADY BRITOMART  Another son! I never said anything of the kind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of interrupting me.
[dubiously]	STEPHEN  I am afraid I should make a poor hand of managing a cannon foundry.
[touched]	LADY BRITOMART  That's my own boy [she pats his cheek]! Your father never could answer that: he used to laugh and get out of it under cover of some affectionate nonsense. And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?
[shocked]	STEPHEN  I never knew that.
[bitterly]	STEPHEN  We are utterly dependent on him and his cannons, then!
[sharply]	LADY BRITOMART  Stephen!
[obstinately]	STEPHEN  I would die sooner than ask him for another penny.
[resignedly]	LADY BRITOMART  You mean that I must ask him. Very well, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You will be glad to know that your grandfather concurs. But he thinks I ought to ask Andrew to come here and see the girls. After all, he must have some natural affection for them.
[reluctantly]	STEPHEN  I suppose so, if the girls cannot do without his money.
[forcibly]	LADY BRITOMART  Barbara: I will not have Charles called Cholly: the vulgarity of it positively makes me ill.
[calling]	SARAH  Come in, Cholly. [Lomax enters, controlling his features very imperfectly, and places himself vaguely between Sarah and Barbara].
[peremptorily]	LADY BRITOMART  Sit down, all of you. [They sit. Cusins crosses to the window and seats himself there. Lomax takes a chair. Barbara sits at the writing table and Sarah on the settee]. I don't in the least know what you are laughing at, Adolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better from Charles Lomax.
[sweetly]	CUSINS  You were not present. It was really funny, I believe.
[remonstrating]	LOMAX  Oh I say!
[frigidly]	LADY BRITOMART  What do you wish to convey, Charles?
[cautiously]	CUSINS  If I may say so, Lady Brit, I think Charles has rather happily expressed what we all feel. Homer, speaking of Autolycus, uses the same phrase.
[handsomely]	LOMAX  Not that I mind, you know, if Sarah don't.
[crushingly]	LADY BRITOMART  Thank you. Have I your permission, Adolphus, to invite my own husband to my own house?
[gallantly]	CUSINS  You have my unhesitating support in everything you do.
[chuckling]	LOMAX  I wonder how the old man will take it.
[abashed]	LOMAX  I didn't mean--at least--
[impatiently]	LADY BRITOMART. Not since she was a little kid, Charles, as you express it with that elegance of diction and refinement of thought that seem never to desert you. Accordingly--er--  Now I have forgotten what I was going to say. That comes of your provoking me to be sarcastic, Charles. Adolphus: will you kindly tell me where I was.
[sweetly]	CUSINS  You were saying that as Mr Undershaft has not seen his children since they were babies, he will form his opinion of the way you have brought them up from their behavior to-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly careful to conduct ourselves well, especially Charles.
[vehemently]	LADY BRITOMART  I did, Charles. Adolphus's recollection is perfectly correct. It is most important that you should be good; and I do beg you for once not to pair off into opposite corners and giggle and whisper while I am speaking to your father.
[apologetically]	UNDERSHAFT  I AM somewhat older. [With a touch of courtship] Time has stood still with you.
[promptly]	LADY BRITOMART  Rubbish! This is your family.
[surprised]	UNDERSHAFT  Is it so large? I am sorry to say my memory is failing very badly in some things. [He offers his hand with paternal kindness to Lomax].
[remonstrating]	LOMAX  No but look here don't you know--[Overcome] Oh I say!
[decisively]	LADY BRITOMART  Andrew: you are talking nonsense. Of course you have only one son.
[bowing]	UNDERSHAFT  Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr Stephen. Then [going to Cusins] you must be my son. [Taking Cusins' hands in his] How are you, my young friend? [To Lady Britomart] He is very like you, my love.
[submissively]	UNDERSHAFT  Yes, my dear: I daresay that will be best. [Making himself comfortable] Well, here I am. Now what can I do for you all?
[outraged]	LADY BRITOMART  Charles Lomax: if you can behave yourself, behave yourself. If not, leave the room.
[encouragingly]	LOMAX  Nobody'd know it, I assure you. You look all right, you know.
[delighted]	LOMAX  Are you? Then I'll get it. [He   goes upstairs for the instrument].
[shocked]	LOMAX  But not your sort of blood and fire, you know.
[scandalized]	LOMAX  Oh I say!
[hastily]	LOMAX  I'm not saying anything against you personally, you know.
[leniently]	LOMAX  Well, the more destructive war becomes, the sooner it will be abolished, eh?
[overtaxed]	LOMAX  Would you mind saying that again? I didn't quite follow it.
[rising]	LOMAX  Oh I say!
[rising]	UNDERSHAFT  I am afraid I must be going.
[Rising]	BARBARA. No, of course not; and it wouldn't matter if you were: half the Army came to their first meeting for a lark.  Come along. Come, Dolly. Come, Cholly. [She goes out with Undershaft, who opens the door for her. Cusins rises].
[continuing]	LADY BRITOMART  But you, Adolphus, can behave yourself if you choose to. I insist on your staying.
[offended]	LADY BRITOMART  Well, go. [He starts for the door]. And remember this, Adolphus [he turns to listen]: I have a very strong suspicion that you went to the Salvation Army to worship Barbara and nothing else. And I quite appreciate the very clever way in which you systematically humbug me. I have found you out. Take care Barbara doesn't. That's all.
[languidly]	SARAH  Very well, mamma. [She goes].
[violently]	LADY BRITOMART  I won't be consoled, Stephen. There is nothing the matter with me. [She rises and goes towards the door].
[sceptically]	THE WOMAN  Yus, I dessay.
[shocked]	RUMMY  Used you to beat your mother?
[gaily]	RUMMY  Keep up your old art! Never say die!
[cheerfully]	PRICE  No good jawrin about it. You're ony a jumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turned-out incurable of an ole workin man: who cares about you? Eh? Make the thievin swine give you a meal: they've stole many a one from you. Get a bit o your own back. [Jenny returns with the usual meal]. There you are, brother. Awsk a blessin an tuck that into you.
[eagerly]	SHIRLEY  Yes, yes: that's true. I can pay you back: it's only a loan. [Shivering] Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He turns to the table and attacks the meal ravenously].
[fervently]	RUMMY  Glory Hallelujah!
[intimidated]	PRICE . No, matey: she ain't anything to do with me.
[stung]	BILL  You lie, you old soupkitchener, you. There was a young man here. Did I offer to hit him or did I not?
[sullenly]	BILL  I'm no music hall wrastler. Can he box?
[checked]	BILL  Garn!
[guessing]	BARBARA  I know. Secularist?
[hotly]	SHIRLEY  Did I offer to deny it?
[insolently]	BILL  Wot's that to you?
[defiantly]	BILL  Yes, it was me that cut her lip. I ain't afraid o you.
[sullenly]	BILL  I want none o your cantin jaw. I suppose you think I come here to beg from you, like this damaged lot here. Not me. I don't want your bread and scrape and catlap. I don't believe in your Gawd, no more than you do yourself.
[considering]	BARBARA  Well, you see, there's no use putting down your name unless I can do something for you, is there? What's your trade?
[complacently]	BARBARA  You see I was right about your trade. [Bill, on the point of retorting furiously, finds himself, to his great shame and terror, in danger of crying instead. He sits down again suddenly]. What's her name?
[dogged]	BILL  Er name's Mog Abbijam: thats wot her name is.
[surprised]	BILL  Wottud she wash it for, the carroty slut? It's red.
[sullenly]	BILL  I ain't afraid of him. I ain't afraid of ennybody. But he can lick me. She's done me. [He sits down moodily on the edge of the horse trough].
[calling]	BARBARA  Jenny!
[critically]	BARBARA  It was as hard as he could hit, I expect. Poor Bill! You don't feel angry with him, do you?
[savagely]	BILL  Don't you talk to me, d'ye hear. You lea me alone, or I'll do you a mischief. I'm not dirt under your feet, anyway.
[calmly]	SHIRLEY  Don't you be afeerd. You ain't such prime company that you need expect to be sought after. [He is about to go into the shelter when Barbara comes out, with Undershaft on her right].
[startled]	UNDERSHAFT  A Secularist! Not the least in the world: on the contrary, a confirmed mystic.
[gravely]	UNDERSHAFT  Poverty, my friend, is not a thing to be proud of.
[angrily]	SHIRLEY  Who made your millions for you? Me and my like. What's kep us poor? Keepin you rich. I wouldn't have your conscience, not for all your income.
[bitterly]	SHIRLEY  Yes: I'm in their debt for a meal, ain't I?
[blustering]	BILL  Make a man o ME! Ain't I a man? eh? ain't I a man? Who sez I'm not a man?
[tormented]	BILL  Av done with it, I tell you. Chock it. I'm sick of your Jenny Ill and er silly little face.
[fervently]	BILL  Gawd elp im! Gawd elp im!
[reflectively]	CUSINS  Yes: I think you're right, Mr Walker. Yes: I should do it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek would have done.
[declaiming]	CUSINS 
[triumphantly]	UNDERSHAFT  Aha! Barbara Undershaft would be. Her inspiration comes from within herself.
[rising]	UNDERSHAFT  And not on Trade Unionism nor Socialism. Excellent.
[revolted]	CUSINS  You really are an infernal old rascal.
[rebounding]	BARBARA  No: don't comfort me. It will be all right. We shall get the money.
[doggedly]	BILL  I did wot I said I'd do. I spit in is eye. E looks up at the sky and sez, "O that I should be fahnd worthy to be spit upon for the gospel's sake!" a sez; an Mog sez "Glory Allelloolier!"; an then a called me Brother, an dahned me as if I was a kid and a was me mother washin me a Setterda nawt. I adn't just no show wiv im at all. Arf the street prayed; an the tother arf larfed fit to split theirselves. [To Barbara] There! are you settisfawd nah?
[fiercely]	BILL  Don't you go bein sorry for me: you've no call. Listen ere. I broke your jawr.
[distressed]	JENNY  Oh no--
[impatiently]	BILL  Tell y'I did: cawn't you listen to wot's bein told you? All I got be it was bein made a sight of in the public street for me pains. Well, if I cawn't settisfaw you one way, I can another. Listen ere! I ad two quid saved agen the frost; an I've a pahnd of it left. A mate n mine last week ad words with the Judy e's goin to marry. E give er wot-for; an e's bin fined fifteen bob. E ad a right to it er because they was goin to be marrid; but I adn't no right to it you; so put anather fawv bob on an call it a pahnd's worth. [He produces a sovereign]. Ere's the money. Take it; and let's av no more o your forgivin an prayin and your Major jawrin me. Let wot I done be done and paid for; and let there be a end of it.
[contemptuously]	BILL  Not likely. I'd give her anather as soon as look at er. Let her av the lawr o me as she threatened! She ain't forgiven me: not mach. Wot I done to er is not on me mawnd--wot she [indicating Barbara] might call on me conscience--no more than stickin a pig. It's this Christian game o yours that I won't av played agen me: this bloomin forgivin an noggin an jawrin that makes a man that sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im. I won't av it, I tell you; so take your money and stop throwin your silly bashed face hup agen me.
[bitterly]	BILL  I know. It ain't enough. Me an me few shillins is not good enough for you. You're a earl's grendorter, you are. Nothin less than a underd pahnd for you.
[sullenly]	BILL  I cawn't stend aht agen music all wrastlers and artful tongued women. I've offered to pay. I can do no more. Take it or leave it. There it is. [He throws the sovereign on the drum, and sits down on the horse-trough. The coin fascinates Snobby Price, who takes an early opportunity of dropping his cap on it].
[astonished]	MRS BAINES  Why not, dear?
[impishly]	CUSINS  Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly! Bless dear Bodger! [Barbara almost breaks down as Adolpbus, too, fails her].
[quietly]	BARBARA  Father: come here.
[taunting]	BILL  Wot prawce Selvytion nah?
[unshamed]	BILL  So I would, mate, and often av, cheerful. But she cawn't buy me. [Approaching Barbara] You wanted my soul, did you? Well, you ain't got it.
[salvationproof]	BILL  It's no good: you cawn't get rahnd me nah. I don't blieve in it; and I've seen today that I was right. [Going] So long, old soupkitchener! Ta, ta, Major Earl's Grendorter! [Turning at the gate] Wot prawce Selvytion nah? Snobby Prawce! Ha! ha!
[urgently]	BARBARA  Yes, yes: you must talk to me. Tell me about Tom Paine's books and Bradlaugh's lectures. Come along.
[patiently]	CUSINS  No. I have been making a night of it with the nominal head of this household: that is all.
[disingenuously]	CUSINS  Well--er--well, possibly, as a collector of religions--
[cunningly]	LOMAX  Not as a drummer, though, you know. You are a very clearheaded brainy chap, Cholly; and it must have been apparent to you that there is a certain amount of tosh about--
[overwhelmed]	LOMAX  You are so awfully strong-minded, Lady Brit--
[rising]	LADY BRITOMART  Don't be sentimental, Andrew. Sit down. [She sits on the settee: he sits beside her, on her left. She comes to the point before he has time to breathe]. Sarah must have 800 pounds a year until Charles Lomax comes into his property. Barbara will need more, and need it permanently, because Adolphus hasn't any property.
[resignedly]	UNDERSHAFT  Yes, my dear: I will see to it. Anything else? for yourself, for instance?
[pouting]	LADY BRITOMART  Then go away.
[deprecatory]	UNDERSHAFT  Go away!
[obstinately]	LADY BRITOMART  There is Stephen.
[disconcerted]	UNDERSHAFT  It won't stay unless it's pinned [he fumbles at it with childish grimaces]--
[coldly]	STEPHEN  Good afternoon.
[sulkily]	UNDERSHAFT  I understand you want to come into the cannon business.
[rising]	UNDERSHAFT  My dear boy: this is an immense relief to me. And I trust it may prove an equally good thing for the country. I was afraid you would consider yourself disparaged and slighted. [He moves towards Stephen as if to shake hands with him].
[stiffly]	STEPHEN  Mother: there must be an end of treating me as a child, if you please. [Lady Britomart recoils, deeply wounded by his tone]. Until last night I did not take your attitude seriously, because I did not think you meant it seriously. But I find now that you left me in the dark as to matters which you should have explained to me years ago. I am extremely hurt and offended. Any further discussion of my intentions had better take place with my father, as between one man and another.
[uneasily]	LADY BRITOMART  What do you think he had better do, Andrew?
[vaguely]	LOMAX  Ahdedoo.
[Magnanimously]	STEPHEN. Well, I am rather busy--er--  Oh well, yes: I'll come. That is, if there is room for me.
[scandalized]	UNDERSHAFT  My dear! It is a spotlessly clean and beautiful hillside town.
[revolted]	CUSINS  You really are a--well, what I was saying yesterday.
[embarrassed]	STEPHEN  Mother--
[enthusiastically]	STEPHEN  Have you two seen the place? Why did you leave us?
[diplomatically]	CUSINS  Not quite. [They all turn and stare at him. He comes from the platform past the shed to Undershaft]. I think--Mind! I am not committing myself in any way as to my future course--but I think the foundling difficulty can be got over.
[Sensation]	CUSINS. So they are in Australia; but here they are outcasts. Their marriage is legal in Australia, but not in England. My mother is my father's deceased wife's sister; and in this island I am consequently a foundling. . Is the subterfuge good enough, Machiavelli?
[thoughtfully]	UNDERSHAFT  Biddy: this may be a way out of the difficulty.
[peremptorily]	CUSINS  Mr Undershaft: you have my terms. Take them or leave them.
[disgusted]	CUSINS  Half!
[firmly]	UNDERSHAFT  Half.
[determinedly]	UNDERSHAFT  No: none of that. You must keep the true faith of an Armorer, or you don't come in here.
[enigmatically]	UNDERSHAFT  A will of which I am a part.
[startled]	BARBARA  Father! Do you know what you are saying; or are you laying a snare for my soul?
[hypnotized]	BARBARA  Before I joined the Salvation Army, I was in my own power; and the consequence was that I never knew what to do with myself. When I joined it, I had not time enough for all the things I had to do.
[approvingly]	UNDERSHAFT  Just so. And why was that, do you suppose?
[revolted]	BARBARA  You saved my soul! What do you mean?
[bewildered]	BARBARA  The seven deadly sins!
[punctured]	UNDERSHAFT  My dear: I have no other means of conveying my ideas.
[rising]	LADY BRITOMART  Children: come home instantly. Andrew: I am exceedingly sorry I allowed you to call on us. You are wickeder than ever. Come at once.
[unruffled]	LOMAX  Well, where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered, don't you know. [To Undershaft] Eh? What?
[violently]	LADY BRITOMART  Don't dare call me Biddy. Charles Lomax: you are a fool. Adolphus Cusins: you are a Jesuit. Stephen: you are a prig. Barbara: you are a lunatic. Andrew: you are a vulgar tradesman. Now you all know my opinion; and my conscience is clear, at all events [she sits down again with a vehemence that almost wrecks the chair].
[grinning]	CUSINS  I may not be able to control my affections, Mac.
[starting]	CUSINS  Plato! You dare quote Plato to me!
[firmly]	CUSINS  Not on any account. I will see the whole establishment blown up with its own dynamite before I will get up at five. My hours are healthy, rational hours eleven to five.
[Calling]	UNDERSHAFT. Come when you please: before a week you will come at six and stay until I turn you out for the sake of your health.  Bilton! [He turns to Lady Britomart, who rises]. My dear: let us leave these two young people to themselves for a moment. [Bilton comes from the shed]. I am going to take you through the gun cotton shed.
[unmoved]	BILTON  No, ma'am. Mr Undershaft has the other gentleman's matches in his pocket.
[abruptly]	LADY BRITOMART  Oh! I beg your pardon. [She goes into the shed].
[Emotionally]	STEPHEN. Well, I just want to say this before I leave you to yourselves. Don't let anything I have said about right and wrong prejudice you against this great chance in life. I have satisfied myself that the business is one of the highest character and a credit to our country.  I am very proud of my father. I-- [Unable to proceed, he presses Cusins' hand and goes hastily into the shed, followed by Bilton].
[overjoyed]	CUSINS  Then you--you--you-- Oh for my drum! [He flourishes imaginary drumsticks].
[gasping]	CUSINS  Middle cl--! A snub! A social snub to ME! from the daughter of a foundling!
[aghast]	THE YOUNG LADY . Your first! Do you mean to say that you began practising on me?
[laughing]	THE DENTIST . Oh, the hospital doesn't count. I only meant my first tooth in private practice. Why didn't you let me give you gas?
[shocked]	THE DENTIST . Oh, don't say that. It makes me feel as if I had hurt you for the sake of five shillings.
[disparagingly]	THE YOUNG LADY . I thought so. (Looking about her again in search of further conclusions.) I suppose you haven't been here long?
[flippantly]	THE YOUNG LADY . Ooooh! what bosh! One patient in six weeks! What difference does it make to you?
[maturely]	PHILIP . No, Dolly: my knowledge of human nature confirms Mr. Valentine's judgment. He is right. Let me introduce Miss Dorothy Clandon, commonly called Dolly. (Valentine bows to Dolly. She nods to him.) I'm Philip Clandon. We're from Madeira, but perfectly respectable, so far.
[astonished]	VALENTINE . I beg your pardon?
[vacantly]	DOLLY . No.
[cheered]	DOLLY . Oh, I forgot. Of course. Perhaps I am.
[dubiously]	VALENTINE . Hm!
[dithyrambically]	DOLLY . Nature's masterpiece!
[desperately]	VALENTINE . May I have a word?
[politely]	PHILIP . Excuse us. Go ahead.
[confidently]	PHILIP . He is.
[emphatically]	DOLLY . Twenty-seven.
[imperturbably]	PHILIP . Thirty-three.
[remonstrating]	VALENTINE . Well, really--(resigning himself.) Thirty-one.
[remorseful]	DOLLY . Yes, so we are.
[apologetic]	PHILIP . We interrupted you, Mr. Valentine.
[shocked]	MRS. CLANDON . Dolly! (Dolly catches her lips with her finger tips, suppressing a little splutter of mirth.)
[reassuringly]	THE PARLOR MAID . Yes, sir. (She goes.)
[vexed]	DOLLY . Oh, how tiresome of you to let it all out! And we've just been pretending that you were a respectable professional man in a first-rate position.
[horrified]	MRS. CLANDON . Oh, Dolly, Dolly! My dearest, how can you be so rude? (To Valentine.) Will you excuse these barbarian children of mine, Mr. Valentine?
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Phil!
[advancing]	GLORIA . Mother: we have a right to know.
[steadfastly]	GLORIA . We three. (Her tone is unmistakable: she is pitting her strength against her mother for the first time. The twins instantly go over to the enemy.)
[wounded]	MRS. CLANDON . In your mouth "we" used to mean you and I, Gloria.
[inexorably]	GLORIA . We have a right to know, mother.
[indignantly]	MRS. CLANDON . Ah! You insist.
[naively]	DOLLY . He did look such a fool!
[quoting]	DOLLY . "Answer all your children's questions, and answer them truthfully, as soon as they are old enough to ask them." See Twentieth Century Motherhood--
[affectionately]	MRS. CLANDON . Of course not, dear. Do you think I don't understand?
[rising]	GLORIA . But, mother--
[obstinately]	GLORIA . It is nonsense to tell us that our father is nothing to us.
[grimly]	MRS. CLANDON . You are not sure?
[eagerly]	DOLLY . Oh, tell us. How long has he given you to pay?
[demurely]	DOLLY . So sorry. You'll tell us, won't you, Mr. Valentine?
[puzzled]	THE PARLOR MAID . Madam?
[contemptuously]	DOLLY . Yes, a Portuguese!
[nervously]	GLORIA . Who?
[hastily]	GLORIA . I am afraid we must be going, Mr. Valentine. It is understood, then, that we meet at half past one. (She makes for the door. Philip goes with her. Valentine retreats to the bell.)
[amused]	CRAMPTON . Very well. (Looking more earnestly at her.) So you want to know my age, do you? I'm fifty-seven.
[grimly]	CRAMPTON . I dare say I do.
[incredulously]	DOLLY . Your mother!!! Quite sure you don't mean your daughter?
[sympathetically]	DOLLY . Tooth bad?
[vindictively]	CRAMPTON . No, not a sorrow. An injury that was done me once: that's all. I don't forget injuries; and I don't want to forget them. (His features settle into an implacable frown.)
[rhapsodically]	VALENTINE . She struck me as being-- (He checks himself, and adds, prosaically) However, that's not business. (He places himself behind Crampton's right shoulder and assumes his professional tone.) Open, please. (Crampton opens his mouth. Valentine puts the mirror in, and examines his teeth.) Hm! You have broken that one. What a pity to spoil such a splendid set of teeth! Why do you crack nuts with them? (He withdraws the mirror, and comes forward to converse with Crampton.)
[Dogmatically.]	CRAMPTON. I've always cracked nuts with them: what else are they for?  The proper way to keep teeth good is to give them plenty of use on bones and nuts, and wash them every day with soap-- plain yellow soap.
[grimly]	CRAMPTON . I wasn't spoiled, at all events.
[placably]	VALENTINE . Oh, the character, I see. (He recommences operations.) A little wider, please. Hm! That one will have to come out: it's past saving. (He withdraws the probe and again comes to the side of the chair to converse.) Don't be alarmed: you shan't feel anything. I'll give you gas.
[politely]	VALENTINE . Some warm water, please. (She retires: and Valentine comes back to the cabinet, not at all put out by Crampton's rudeness, and carries on the conversation whilst he selects a forceps and places it ready to his hand with a gag and a drinking glass.) You were asking me what the devil that was to me. Well, I have an idea of getting married myself.
[unperturbed]	VALENTINE . Hm! A father, too, perhaps, as well as a husband, Mr. Crampton?
[politely]	VALENTINE . Damn them?--eh?
[jealously]	CRAMPTON . No, sir: the children are as much mine as hers. (The parlor maid brings in a jug of hot water.)
[irritably]	CRAMPTON . I advise you to get my tooth out and have done reminding me of my wife. Come along, man. (He grips the arms of the chair and braces himself.)
[gravely]	McCOMAS . I do not frequent meetings now.
[resolutely]	MRS. CLANDON . Yes: I have not gone back one inch; and I have educated Gloria to take up my work where I left it. That is what has brought me back to England: I felt that I had no right to bury her alive in Madeira--my St. Helena, Finch. I suppose she will be howled at as I was; but she is prepared for that.
[shocked]	MRS. CLANDON . Socialism.
[emphatically]	MRS. CLANDON . But I can prove to her that Socialism is a fallacy.
[touchingly]	McCOMAS . It is by proving that, Mrs. Clandon, that I have lost all my young disciples. Be careful what you do: let her go her own way. (With some bitterness.) We're old-fashioned: the world thinks it has left us behind. There is only one place in all England where your opinions would still pass as advanced.
[Agitated.]	MRS. CLANDON. --and partly because I want you to explain everything to the children. They know nothing; and now that we have come back to England, it is impossible to leave them in ignorance any longer.  Finch: I cannot bring myself to tell them. I-- (She is interrupted by the twins and Gloria. Dolly comes tearing up the steps, racing Philip, who combines a terrific speed with unhurried propriety of bearing which, however, costs him the race, as Dolly reaches her mother first and almost upsets the garden seat by the precipitancy of her arrival.)
[breathless]	DOLLY . It's all right, mamma. The dentist is coming; and he's bringing his old man.
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Dear, dear children: don't be silly. Everything is so new to them here, Finch, that they are in the wildest spirits. They think every Englishman they meet is a joke.
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Dearest: Mr. McComas will lunch with us.
[nervously]	McCOMAS . Not at all, my dear young lady: not at all. At the same time, this is rather sudden. I was hardly prepared--er--
[suspiciously]	DOLLY . Oh, we don't want anything prepared.
[emphatically]	DOLLY . Bald headed.
[nettled]	McCOMAS . I hope you intend to take what I have to say seriously.
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Phil--
[interrupting]	DOLLY . How old is he?
[softly]	MRS. CLANDON . Dear Dolly: don't let us interrupt Mr. McComas.
[emphatically]	McCOMAS . Thank you, Mrs. Clandon. Thank you. (To Dolly.) Your father is fifty-seven.
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Dolly, Dolly!
[whimpering]	DOLLY . You needn't be so cross. Crampton isn't your father.
[vehemently]	DOLLY . An awful old man! (reproachfully) And you began as if you had quite a nice father for us.
[angrily]	McCOMAS . How do you know that he is not nice? And what right have you to choose your own father? (raising his voice.) Let me tell you, Miss Clandon, that you are too young to--
[delighted]	DOLLY . Oh, what did I always say, Phil?
[urgently]	MRS. CLANDON . Finch: do you realize what is happening? Do you understand that my children have invited that man to lunch, and that he will be here in a few moments?
[impressively]	PHILIP . Steady, Finch. Think it out slowly and carefully. He's coming--coming to lunch.
[proudly]	GLORIA . Do not stir, mother. I shall not stir. We must not run away.
[Calling]	PHILIP. The very man!  William!
[horrified]	McCOMAS . The waiter! Stop, stop! I will not permit this. I--
[outraged]	McCOMAS . Well, of all the--
[impressed]	WAITER . Oh, beg pardon, sir, I'm sure. A son of Mr. Crampton's! Dear me!
[puzzled]	WAITER . Yes, sir. (Diplomatically.) Don't usually lunch with his family, perhaps, sir?
[impressively]	PHILIP . William: he does not know that we are his family. He has not seen us for eighteen years. He won't know us. (To emphasize the communication he seats himself on the iron table with a spring, and looks at the waiter with his lips compressed and his legs swinging.)
[dazzled]	DOLLY . I never thought of that.
[abruptly]	PHILIP . Finch: come and wash your hands. (Seizes his arm and leads him toward the hotel.)
[startled]	CRAMPTON . Eighteen years!
[coolly]	VALENTINE . On, indeed! Interesting meeting! (He resumes his study of the menu.)
[decisively]	VALENTINE . Bosh! (He throws the menu down and goes round the table to look out unconcernedly over the parapet.)
[angrily]	CRAMPTON . What d'ye-- (McComas, followed by Philip and Dolly, comes out. He vacillates for a moment on seeing Crampton.)
[conventionally]	DOLLY . Pleased to meet you again. (She wanders idly round the table, exchanging a smile and a word of greeting with Valentine on the way.)
[firmly]	McCOMAS . Apollinaris only. I prefer to take nothing heating. (He walks away to the side of the terrace, like a man putting temptation behind him.)
[pusillanimously]	McCOMAS . There is no reason why it should not be pleasant. (He looks abjectly gloomy.)
[grimly]	CRAMPTON . I daresay. A man does change in eighteen years.
[troubled]	MRS. CLANDON . I--I did not mean that. I hope your health is good.
[Bitterly.]	CRAMPTON. Ha!  The head of the table!
[scandalized]	McCOMAS . No--no, thank you.
[bitterly]	CRAMPTON . Yes, a guest at the head of my own table. (The soup plates are removed.)
[sympathetically]	DOLLY . Yes: it's embarrassing, isn't it? It's just as bad for us, you know.
[cheerfully]	WAITER . Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. Small Lager for you, sir. (To Crampton.) Seltzer and Irish, sir. (To McComas.) Apollinaris, sir. (To Dolly.) Small Lager, miss. (To Mrs. Clandon, pouring out wine.) 413, madam. (To Valentine.) Large Lager for you, sir. (To Gloria.) 413, miss.
[drinking]	DOLLY . To the family!
[drinking]	PHILIP. . Hearth and Home! (Fish is served.)
[critically]	DOLLY . After all! After all what, Finch?
[sarcastically]	CRAMPTON . He means that you are getting on very nicely in spite of the presence of your father. Do I take your point rightly, Mr. McComas?
[disconcerted]	McCOMAS . No, no. I only said "after all" to round off the sentence. I--er--er--er---
[tactfully]	WAITER . Turbot, sir?
[patronizingly]	McCOMAS . A potman, eh?
[embarrassed]	McCOMAS . I'm sure I beg your pardon.
[calmly]	WAITER . No, sir, not democracy: only education, sir. Scholarships, sir. Cambridge Local, sir. Sidney Sussex College, sir. (Dolly plucks his sleeve and whispers as he bends down.) Stone ginger, miss? Right, miss. (To McComas.) Very good thing for him, sir: he never had any turn for real work, sir. (He goes into the hotel, leaving the company somewhat overwhelmed by his son's eminence.)
[doggedly]	CRAMPTON . While he's a waiter it's his business to wait. If you had treated him as a waiter ought to be treated, he'd have held his tongue.
[firmly]	MRS. CLANDON . Sit down, Fergus. There is no occasion at all for this outburst. You must remember that Dolly is just like a foreigner here. Pray sit down.
[furiously]	CRAMPTON . Margaret: call that girl back. Call her back, I say.
[steadfastly]	GLORIA . Yes: a good mother.
[discreetly]	WAITER . That's the younger lady's, sir. (Valentine lets it go.) Thank you, sir. If you'll allow me, sir, I think you had better have this. (He puts down the sunshades on Crampton's chair, and produces from the tail pocket of his dress coat, a book with a lady's handkerchief between the leaves, marking the page.) The eldest young lady is reading it at present. (Valentine takes it eagerly.) Thank you, sir. Schopenhauer, sir, you see. (He takes up the sunshades again.) Very interesting author, sir: especially on the subject of ladies, sir. (He goes down the steps. Valentine, about to follow him, recollects Crampton and changes his mind.)
[pugnaciously]	CRAMPTON . Ashamed of myself! What for?
[heartrent]	CRAMPTON . She told you what I am--a father--a father robbed of his children. What are the hearts of this generation like? Am I to come here after all these years--to see what my children are for the first time! to hear their voices!--and carry it all off like a fashionable visitor; drop in to lunch; be Mr. Crampton--M i s t e r Crampton! What right have they to talk to me like that? I'm their father: do they deny that? I'm a man, with the feelings of our common humanity: have I no rights, no claims? In all these years who have I had round me? Servants, clerks, business acquaintances. I've had respect from them--aye, kindness. Would one of them have spoken to me as that girl spoke?--would one of them have laughed at me as that boy was laughing at me all the time? (Frantically.) My own children! M i s t e r Crampton! My--
[wildly]	CRAMPTON . Yes: "good-bye, father." Oh, yes: she got at my feelings--with a stab!
[incredulously]	CRAMPTON . Are you in love with my daughter?
[delicately]	WAITER . Steady, sir, steady.
[philosophically]	WAITER . Well, sir, you never can tell. That's a principle in life with me, sir, if you'll excuse my having such a thing, sir. (Delicately sinking the philosopher in the waiter for a moment.) Perhaps you haven't noticed that you hadn't touched that seltzer and Irish, sir, when the party broke up. (He takes the tumbler from the luncheon table, and sets if before Crampton.) Yes, sir, you never can tell. There was my son, sir! who ever thought that he would rise to wear a silk gown, sir? And yet to-day, sir, nothing less than fifty guineas, sir. What a lesson, sir!
[reflectively]	WAITER . Well, yes, sir: that's a way of looking at it, too, sir. I have always said that the great advantage of a hotel is that it's a refuge from home life, sir.
[emphatically]	GLORIA . No. That I c a n n o t understand. I have no sympathy with--
[firmly]	GLORIA . You see! Everything comes right if we only think it resolutely out.
[angrily]	CRAMPTON . She had no right to do it. I will not allow this.
[unmoved]	GLORIA . If you describe things to me, no doubt I shall presently imagine that I remember them. But I really remember nothing.
[wistfully]	CRAMPTON . Has your mother never told you anything about me?
[mercilessly]	GLORIA . The whip you bought to beat me with.
[panting]	VALENTINE . What's the matter? (Looking round.) Where's Crampton?
[cautiously]	VALENTINE . I see. May I ask just this one question? Is your objection an objection to marriage as an institution, or merely an objection to marrying me personally?
[interested]	GLORIA . Ah, now you are beginning to talk humanly and sensibly, Mr. Valentine.
[earnestly]	GLORIA . I hope to meet many such people in England.
[dubiously]	VALENTINE . Hm! There are a good many people here-- nearly forty millions. They're not all consumptive members of the highly educated classes like the people in Madeira.
[amazed]	GLORIA . That's strange--very strange! I had the same presentiment.
[Rising.]	VALENTINE. How extraordinary!  Well: shall we run away?
[contemptuously]	GLORIA . Nonsense!
[obstinately]	VALENTINE . Yes, lies. (He sits down again beside her.) Do you expect me to believe that you are the most beautiful woman in the world?
[passionately]	VALENTINE. . No, no: I can't face that: I must have one illusion left--the illusion about you. I love you. (He turns towards her as if the impulse to touch her were ungovernable: she rises and stands on her guard wrathfully. He springs up impatiently and retreats a step.) Oh, what a fool I am!--an idiot! You don't understand: I might as well talk to the stones on the beach. (He turns away, discouraged.)
[puzzled]	VALENTINE . He? (Recollecting.) Oh, Crampton. Gone this long time, Mrs. Clandon. (He runs off buoyantly down the steps.)
[amazed]	MRS. CLANDON . My child: I did my best.
[wearily]	GLORIA . Shall I ring?
[returning]	GLORIA . Yes.
[recoiling]	GLORIA . Ah, no, no. Oh, don't say that. Oh! (She rises and turns away with a gesture as if tearing herself.)
[mildly]	MRS. CLANDON . My dear: what is the matter? What-- (The waiter enters with the tea tray.)
[balmily]	WAITER . This was what you rang for, ma'am, I hope?
[cheerfully]	WAITER . Anything more, ma'am?
[ravenously]	DOLLY . Oh, give me some tea. (Mrs. Clandon pours out a cup for her.) We've been out in a boat. Valentine will be here presently.
[incredulously]	MRS. CLANDON . Phil! Dolly! Are you joking? (They shake their heads.) Did she allow it?
[overwhelmed]	VALENTINE . Oh, really, Mrs.-- (Recovering himself.) I should be only too proud if you were.
[restlessly]	VALENTINE . What are you driving at, Mrs. Clandon?
[surrendering]	VALENTINE . Well, yes: I'm in love with Gloria. (Interposing as she is about to speak.) I know what you're going to say: I've no money.
[protesting]	VALENTINE . Amuse myself! Oh, Mrs. Clandon!
[relentlessly]	MRS. CLANDON . On your honor, Mr. Valentine, are you in earnest?
[desperately]	VALENTINE . On my honor I am in earnest. (She looks searchingly at him. His sense of humor gets the better of him; and he adds quaintly) Only, I always have been in earnest; and yet--here I am, you see!
[Severely.]	MRS. CLANDON. This is just what I suspected.  Mr. Valentine: you are one of those men who play with women's affections.
[stiffly]	MRS. CLANDON . I am always willing to learn.
[contemptuously]	MRS. CLANDON . No.
[rising]	MRS. CLANDON . Mr. Valentine: you are very clever.
[horrified]	VALENTINE . Good-bye! Oh, mayn't I see her before I go?
[thoughtfully]	VALENTINE . That's a good sign. Good-bye. (He bows and makes for the door, apparently well satisfied.)
[alarmed]	MRS. CLANDON . Why do you think it a good sign?
[murmuring]	VALENTINE . This gentleman! Oh!
[sharply]	MRS. CLANDON . Mr. Valentine: can you hold your tongue for a moment? (He looks piteously at them; then, with a despairing shrug, goes back to the ottoman and throws his hat on it.)
[continuing]	GLORIA . --but I have at least the right to be left alone in my disgrace. I am one of those weak creatures born to be mastered by the first man whose eye is caught by them; and I must fulfill my destiny, I suppose. At least spare me the humiliation of trying to save me. (She sits down, with her handkerchief to her eyes, at the farther end of the table.)
[recklessly]	VALENTINE . No: I will speak: I've been silent for nearly thirty seconds. (He goes up to Gloria.) Miss Clandon--
[bitterly]	GLORIA . Oh, not Miss Clandon: you have found that it is quite safe to call me Gloria.
[emphatically]	MRS. CLANDON . Mr. Valentine: you are a most dangerous man. Gloria: come here. (Gloria, wondering a little at the command, obeys, and stands, with drooping head, on her mother's right hand, Valentine being on the opposite side. Mrs. Clandon then begins, with intense scorn.) Ask this man whom you have inspired and made brave, how many women have inspired him before (Gloria looks up suddenly with a flash of jealous anger and amazement); how many times he has laid the trap in which he has caught you; how often he has baited it with the same speeches; how much practice it has taken to make him perfect in his chosen part in life as the Duellist of Sex.
[bluntly]	VALENTINE . Yes. (Gloria raises her clenched hands.)
[remonstrating]	VALENTINE . Oh!
[philosophically]	VALENTINE . It's surprising how little difference there is between the two. (Gloria turns indignantly away from him. He continues, to Mrs. Clandon) I know men whose wives love them; and they go on exactly like that.
[gaily]	VALENTINE . Of course: that's the sensible way of looking at it. Come, Mrs. Clandon: you can't quarrel with a mere butterfly like me.
[going]	MRS. CLANDON . Oh, very well: I'll go to him.
[unabashed]	VALENTINE . Well, I don't care. I can't be unhappy about anything. I shall never be unhappy again, never, never, never, while grass grows or water runs. The thought of you will always make me wild with joy. (Some quick taunt is on her lips: he interposes swiftly.) No: I never said that before: that's new.
[discreetly]	PHILIP . I beg your pardon. Come, Dolly. (He turns to go.)
[annoyed]	GLORIA . Mother will be back in a moment, Phil. (Severely.) Please wait here for her. (She turns away to the window, where she stands looking out with her back to them.)
[significantly]	PHILIP . Oh, indeed. Hmhm!
[sternly]	McCOMAS . Very serious news from your father, Miss Clandon. Very serious news indeed. (He crosses to the ottoman, and sits down. Dolly, looking deeply impressed, follows him and sits beside him on his right.)
[touched]	DOLLY . Oh, how nice of him! He likes us, mamma.
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . D e a r e s t Dolly! (To McComas.) The deed of separation gives me the custody of the children.
[offended]	McCOMAS . In that case, sir, you must not be surprised to find yourself regarded by the young lady's father as a fortune hunter.
[revolted]	McCOMAS . I have nothing more to say, sir. I shall return and tell Mr. Crampton that this family is no place for a father. (He makes for the door.)
[scornfully]	MRS. CLANDON . No doubt.
[hastily]	McCOMAS . No. Of course not.
[wistfully]	McCOMAS . Women can be very hard, Mrs. Clandon.
[angrily]	GLORIA . Be silent. (He subsides.)
[unmoved]	MRS. CLANDON . No, Dolly: I hardly got any lunch. My dear Finch: there is not the least use in talking to me about Fergus. You have never been married to him: I have.
[defiantly]	GLORIA . You appeal from her strength to my weakness!
[defeated]	McCOMAS . Well, I am very sorry--very sorry. I have done my best. (He rises and prepares to go, deeply dissatisfied.)
[rising]	VALENTINE . I quite agree with you. I think it's most important.
[prosaically]	VALENTINE . How is a man to look dignified when he's infatuated?
[smiling]	WAITER . You may depend on me for that, sir. My own name is Boon, sir, though I am best known down here as Balmy Walters, sir. By rights I should spell it with the aitch you, sir; but I think it best not to take that liberty, sir. There is Norman blood in it, sir; and Norman blood is not a recommendation to a waiter.
[plaintively]	CRAMPTON . If they will only be fair to me!
[intolerantly]	McCOMAS . You won't get your rights. Now, once for all, Crampton, did your promises of good behavior only mean that you won't complain if there's nothing to complain of? Because, if so-- (He moves as if to go.)
[miserably]	CRAMPTON . No, no: let me alone, can't you? I've been bullied enough: I've been tormented enough. I tell you I'll do my best. But if that girl begins to talk to me like that and to look at me like-- (He breaks off and buries his head in his hands.)
[relenting]	McCOMAS . There, there: it'll be all right, if you will only bear and forbear. Come, pull yourself together: there's someone coming. (Crampton, too dejected to care much, hardly changes his attitude. Gloria enters from the garden; McComas goes to meet her at the window; so that he can speak to her without being heard by Crampton.) There he is, Miss Clandon. Be kind to him. I'll leave you with him for a moment. (He goes into the garden. Gloria comes in and strolls coolly down the middle of the room.)
[angry]	CRAMPTON . What! (Her odd expression does not alter. He surrenders.) Well, yes, my dear: I suppose it is, I suppose it is. (She nods sympathetically.) I'm afraid I'm sometimes a little irritable; but I know what's right and reasonable all the time, even when I don't act on it. Can you believe that?
[quickly]	GLORIA . Yes, mother. (She turns to him on her knees and seizes his hands.) Now listen. No treason to her: no word, no thought against her. She is our superior--yours and mine--high heavens above us. Is that agreed?
[coldly]	GLORIA . I am sorry my mother is not here to receive you, Mr. Valentine. It is not quite nine o'clock; and the gentleman of whom Mr. McComas spoke, the lawyer, is not yet come.
[ruthlessly]	BOHUN . It was I.
[brokenly]	WAITER . Yes, sir. (Unable to restrain his tears.) You in a false nose, Walter! (He sinks faintly into a chair at the table.) I beg pardon, ma'am, I'm sure. A little giddiness--
[commandingly]	BOHUN . You will excuse him, Mrs. Clandon, when I inform you that he is my father.
[heartbroken]	WAITER . Oh, no, no, Walter. A waiter for your father on the top of a false nose! What will they think of you?
[pleading]	WAITER . I hope it may not be necessary, sir. Busy evening for me, sir, with that ball: very busy evening indeed, sir.
[inexorably]	BOHUN . We shall want you.
[politely]	MRS. CLANDON . Sit down, won't you?
[earnestly]	WAITER . Oh, if you please, ma'am, I really must draw the line at sitting down. I couldn't let myself be seen doing such a thing, ma'am: thank you, I am sure, all the same. (He looks round from face to face wretchedly, with an expression that would melt a heart of stone.)
[beaming]	WAITER . Claret cup, ma'am! Certainly, ma'am.
[delighted]	WAITER . Cucumber, miss! yes, miss. (To Bohun.) Anything special for you, sir? You don't like cucumber, sir.
[dazed]	VALENTINE . This is simply breaking a butterfly on a wheel. What does it matter? (He sits down again.)
[timidly]	McCOMAS . I think, Bohun, we had perhaps better dispose of the important questions first.
[flatteringly]	McCOMAS . If I did--
[uneasily]	CRAMPTON . It's a very difficult question to answer, Mr. Bohun.
[warningly]	GLORIA . Father!
[impatiently]	MRS. CLANDON . Do you suppose I choose their clothes for them? Really this is childish.
[calmly]	BOHUN . You did. (To the waiter, who is going out.) Just wait a bit.
[pleading]	CRAMPTON . Mr. Bohun: consider my position for a moment. I haven't got myself alone to consider: there's my sister Sophronia and my brother-in-law and all their circle. They have a great horror of anything that is at all--at all--well--
[reassuringly]	WAITER . Oh, dear, no, ma'am. (Persuasively.) Oh, no, sir, not at all. A little pretty and tasty no doubt; but very choice and classy--very genteel and high toned indeed. Might be the son and daughter of a Dean, sir, I assure you, sir. You have only to look at them, sir, to-- (At this moment a harlequin and columbine, dancing to the music of the band in the garden, which has just reached the coda of a waltz, whirl one another into the room. The harlequin's dress is made of lozenges, an inch square, of turquoise blue silk and gold alternately. His hat is gilt and his mask turned up. The columbine's petticoats are the epitome of a harvest field, golden orange and poppy crimson, with a tiny velvet jacket for the poppy stamens. They pass, an exquisite and dazzling apparition, between McComas and Bohun, and then back in a circle to the end of the table, where, as the final chord of the waltz is struck, they make a tableau in the middle of the company, the harlequin down on his left knee, and the columbine standing on his right knee, with her arms curved over her head. Unlike their dancing, which is charmingly graceful, their attitudinizing is hardly a success, and threatens to end in a catastrophe.)
[screaming]	THE COLUMBINE . Lift me down, somebody: I'm going to fall. Papa: lift me down.
[obstinately]	DOLLY . Never mind my age. Is it pretty?
[rising]	DOLLY . Oh, dear, you are a regular overwhelmer! Do you always go on like this?
[rising]	BOHUN . Yes. Don't you try to put me out of countenance, young lady: you're too young to do it. (He takes McComas's chair from beside Mrs. Clandon's and sets it beside his own.) Sit down. (Dolly, fascinated, obeys; and Bohun sits down again. McComas, robbed of his seat, takes a chair on the other side between the table and the ottoman.) Now, Mr. Crampton, the facts are before you--both of them. You think you'd like to have your two youngest children to live with you. Well, you wouldn't-- (Crampton tries to protest; but Bohun will not have it on any terms.) No, you wouldn't: you think you would; but I know better than you. You'd want this young lady here to give up dressing like a stage columbine in the evening and like a fashionable columbine in the morning. Well, she won't--never. She thinks she will; but--
[pepperily]	VALENTINE . Don't you interrupt me, sir: this is something really serious. I i n s i s t on knowing who Miss Clandon said that to.
[coldly]	GLORIA . What are we discussing now, pray?
[capitulating]	BOHUN . Mrs. Clandon: these are clever children-- clear headed, well brought up children. I make that admission deliberately. Can you, in return, point out to me any way of inducting them to hold their tongues?
[softer]	WAITER . Be quick, sir: be quick.
[flushing]	GLORIA . Mr. Bohun!
[rising]	GLORIA . Stop. I warn you, Mr. Bohun, not to answer for my intentions.
[rising]	BOHUN . It's no use, Miss Clandon: you can't put me down. I tell you your name will soon be neither Clandon nor Crampton; and I could tell you what it will be if I chose. (He goes to the other end of the table, where he unrolls his domino, and puts the false nose on the table. When he moves they all rise; and Phil goes to the window. Bohun, with a gesture, summons the waiter to help him in robing.) Mr. Crampton: your notion of going to law is all nonsense: your children will be of age before you could get the point decided. (Allowing the waiter to put the domino on his shoulders.) You can do nothing but make a friendly arrangement. If you want your family more than they want you, you'll get the worse of the arrangement: if they want you more than you want them, you'll get the better of it. (He shakes the domino into becoming folds and takes up the false nose. Dolly gazes admiringly at him.) The strength of their position lies in their being very agreeable people personally. The strength of your position lies in your income. (He claps on the false nose, and is again grotesquely transfigured.)
[thunderously]	BOHUN . Yes: you think I can't; but I can. Come along. (He seizes her and dances off with her through the window in a most powerful manner, but with studied propriety and grace. The waiter is meanwhile busy putting the chairs back in their customary places.)
[Pointedly.]	McCOMAS. Crampton: you are not the man I took you for.  Bullies are always cowards. (He goes disgustedly towards the window.)
[suavely]	WAITER . Oh, dear, yes, sir: the false one will fit over it quite easily, sir: plenty of room, sir, plenty of room. (He goes out after McComas.)
[petulantly]	GLORIA . I don't know. Yes, I d o know. Let us go and see the dancing. (They go towards the window, and are met by Valentine, who comes in from the garden walking quickly, with his face set and sulky.)
[stiffly]	VALENTINE . Excuse me. I thought the party had quite broken up.
[nagging]	GLORIA . Then why did you come back?
[shocked]	MRS. CLANDON . Oh, my d e a r e s t Gloria, Mr. Valentine will think that rude.
[proudly]	GLORIA . Keep your own Gloria--the Gloria of your imagination. (Her emotion begins to break through her pride.) The real Gloria--the Gloria who was shocked, offended, horrified--oh, yes, quite truly--who was driven almost mad with shame by the feeling that all her power over herself had been broken down at her first real encounter with--with-- (The color rushes over her face again. She covers it with her left hand, and puts her right on his left arm to support herself.)
[tumultuously]	DOLLY . Oh, my feelings! I want to kiss somebody; and we bar it in the family. Where's Finch?
[resolutely]	GLORIA . Yes. Do you intend to be our friend or--
[interposing]	DOLLY . --or our father?
[determinedly]	GLORIA . You shall not go.
[quailing]	VALENTINE . No, dearest: of course not. But--oh, will somebody only talk sense for a moment and bring us all to reason! I can't. Where's Bohun? Bohun's the man. Phil: go and summon Bohun--
[re-appearing]	PHILIP . He comes. (He waves his bat over the window. Bohun comes in, taking off his false nose and throwing it on the table in passing as he comes between Gloria and Valentine.)
[proudly]	GLORIA . He shall have a settlement.
[protesting]	McCOMAS . Pray restrain--really--(He is borne off dancing through the window.)
[remonstrating]	MRS. CLANDON . Phil, Phil-- (She shares McComas's fate.)

[hopefully]	THE FLOWER GIRL  I can give you change for a tanner, kind lady.
[protesting]	THE FLOWER GIRL  Who's trying to deceive you? I called him Freddy or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a stranger and wished to be pleasant. [She sits down beside her basket].
[suspiciously]	THE BYSTANDER  Who told you my people come from Selsey?
[appalled]	THE FLOWER GIRL  Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove? It wasn't fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay four-and-six a week. [In tears] Oh, boo--hoo--oo--
[promptly]	THE NOTE TAKER  Hoxton.
[amazed]	THE SARCASTIC ONE  Well, who said I didn't? Bly me! You know everything, you do.
[violently]	THE DAUGHTER  Will you please keep your impertinent remarks to yourself?
[helpfully]	THE NOTE TAKER  _H_anwell.
[explosively]	THE NOTE TAKER  Woman: cease this detestable boohooing instantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.
[eagerly]	THE NOTE TAKER  Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanscrit?
[returning]	MRS. PEARCE  This is the young woman, sir.
[stupent]	HIGGINS  WELL!!! [Recovering his breath with a gasp] What do you expect me to say to you?
[gently]	PICKERING  What is it you want, my girl?
[peremptorily]	HIGGINS  Sit down.
[severely]	MRS. PEARCE  Sit down, girl. Do as you're told. [She places the stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and Pickering, and stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down].
[coyly]	LIZA  Don't mind if I do. [She sits down. Pickering returns to the hearthrug].
[haughtily]	LIZA  Who told you I only--
[continuing]	HIGGINS  She offers me two-fifths of her day's income for a lesson. Two-fifths of a millionaire's income for a day would be somewhere about 60 pounds. It's handsome. By George, it's enormous! it's the biggest offer I ever had.
[weeping]	LIZA  But I ain't got sixty pounds. Oh--
[laughing]	PICKERING  He did. I think it must be regarded as her property, Mrs. Pearce.
[uneasy]	MRS. PEARCE  Oh, don't say that, sir: there's more ways than one of turning a girl's head; and nobody can do it better than Mr. Higgins, though he may not always mean it. I do hope, sir, you won't encourage him to do anything foolish.
[protesting]	MRS. PEARCE . Yes; but--
[resolutely]	MRS. PEARCE  You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins: really you must. You can't walk over everybody like this.
[patiently]	HIGGINS  What's the matter?
[whimpering]	LIZA  Nah--ow. You got no right to touch me.
[Impatiently]	HIGGINS. Oh, pay her whatever is necessary: put it down in the housekeeping book.  What on earth will she want with money? She'll have her food and her clothes. She'll only drink if you give her money.
[impatiently]	HIGGINS  What's to become of her if I leave her in the gutter? Tell me that, Mrs. Pearce.
[overwhelmed]	LIZA  Ah--ah--ow--oo!
[patiently]	MRS. PEARCE  I think you'd better let me speak to the girl properly in private. I don't know that I can take charge of her or consent to the arrangement at all. Of course I know you don't mean her any harm; but when you get what you call interested in people's accents, you never think or care what may happen to them or you. Come with me, Eliza.
[moodily]	HIGGINS  Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
[eagerly]	HIGGINS  Well, Mrs. Pearce: is it all right?
[sternly]	HIGGINS  Of course. I'm always particular about what I say. Why do you say this to me?
[unmoved]	MRS. PEARCE  No, sir: you're not at all particular when you've mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn't matter before me: I'm used to it. But you really must not swear before the girl.
[indignantly]	HIGGINS  I swear! [Most emphatically] I never swear. I detest the habit. What the devil do you mean?
[stolidly]	MRS. PEARCE  That's what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal too much. I don't mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil and where the devil and who the devil--
[loftily]	HIGGINS  I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it, Mrs. Pearce. [She looks at him steadfastly. He adds, hiding an uneasy conscience with a judicial air] Except perhaps in a moment of extreme and justifiable excitement.
[yelling]	HIGGINS  Oh very well, very well: I'll wipe them in my hair in future.
[rising]	PICKERING  Phew! I say! [He retreats to the hearthrug].
[promptly]	HIGGINS  Send the blackguard up.
[confidently]	HIGGINS  Oh no: I think not. If there's any trouble he shall have it with me, not I with him. And we are sure to get something interesting out of him.
[menacingly]	DOOLITTLE  I want my daughter: that's what I want. See?
[remonstrating]	DOOLITTLE  Now, now, look here, Governor.  Is this reasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of a man like this? The girl belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in? [He sits down again].
[protesting]	DOOLITTLE  No, Governor.
[sweetly]	DOOLITTLE  Well, what would a man come for? Be human, governor.
[disarmed]	HIGGINS  Alfred: did you put her up to it?
[determinedly]	HIGGINS  You're going to take her away, double quick. [He crosses to the hearth and rings the bell].
[rising]	DOOLITTLE  No, Governor. Don't say that. I'm not the man to stand in my girl's light. Here's a career opening for her, as you might say; and--
[desperate]	DOOLITTLE  Where's the clothes she come in? Did I burn them or did your missus here?
[revolted]	HIGGINS  Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you would sell your daughter for 50 pounds?
[unabashed]	DOOLITTLE  Can't afford them, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Liza is going to have a bit out of this, why not me too?
[troubled]	HIGGINS  I don't know what to do, Pickering. There can be no question that as a matter of morals it's a positive crime to give this chap a farthing. And yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his claim.
[conscientiously]	HIGGINS  Oh! Quite right, Mrs. Pearce. [To Eliza] Yes: damned silly.
[blandly]	MRS. PEARCE  Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter.
[impressively]	HIGGINS  Stop. You'll come regularly to see your daughter. It's your duty, you know. My brother is a clergyman; and he could help you in your talks with her.
[evasively]	DOOLITTLE  Certainly. I'll come, Governor. Not just this week, because I have a job at a distance. But later on you may depend on me. Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma'am. [He takes off his hat to Mrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He winks at Higgins, thinking him probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce's difficult disposition, and follows her].
[dismayed]	MRS. HIGGINS  Henry [scolding him]! What are you doing here to-day? It is my at home day: you promised not to come. [As he bends to kiss her, she takes his hat off, and presents it to him].
[impatiently]	HIGGINS  Well, she must talk about something. [He controls himself and sits down again]. Oh, she'll be all right: don't you fuss. Pickering is in it with me. I've a sort of bet on that I'll pass her off as a duchess in six months. I started on her some months ago; and she's getting on like a house on fire. I shall win my bet. She has a quick ear; and she's been easier to teach than my middle-class pupils because she's had to learn a complete new language. She talks English almost as you talk French.
[introducing]	MRS. HIGGINS  My son Henry.
[gaily]	MISS EYNSFORD HILL  I don't. [She sits in the Elizabethan chair].
[Introducing]	MRS. HIGGINS. Very good of you to come.  Colonel Pickering.
[bowing]	FREDDY  Ahdedo?
[resignedly]	HIGGINS  It don't matter, anyhow. Sit down. He shakes Freddy's hand, and almost slings him on the ottoman with his face to the windows; then comes round to the other side of it.
[gaily]	MISS EYNSFORD HILL  Is it so very cynical?
[seriously]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  Oh! I'm sure you don't mean that, Mr. Higgins.
[warningly]	MRS. HIGGINS  Or of manners, Henry?
[cordially]	MRS. HIGGINS  Quite right: I'm very glad indeed to see you.
[introducing]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  My daughter Clara.
[impulsively]	CLARA  How do you do? [She sits down on the ottoman beside Eliza, devouring her with her eyes].
[introducing]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  My son Freddy.
[suddenly]	HIGGINS  By George, yes: it all comes back to me! [They stare at him]. Covent Garden! [Lamentably] What a damned thing!
[sulkily]	HIGGINS  Sorry.
[darkly]	LIZA  My aunt died of influenza: so they said.
[puzzled]	MRS. HIGGINS  Done her in?
[startled]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  Dear me!
[hastily]	HIGGINS  Oh, that's the new small talk. To do a person in means to kill them.
[Cheerfully]	LIZA. Not a bit. It never did him no harm what I could see. But then he did not keep it up regular.  On the burst, as you might say, from time to time. And always more agreeable when he had a drop in. When he was out of work, my mother used to give him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until he'd drunk himself cheerful and loving-like. There's lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with. [Now quite at her ease] You see, it's like this. If a man has a bit of a conscience, it always takes him when he's sober; and then it makes him low-spirited. A drop of booze just takes that off and makes him happy. [To Freddy, who is in convulsions of suppressed laughter] Here! what are you sniggering at?
[interposing]	MRS. HIGGINS  Not at all, Miss Doolittle.
[Expansively]	LIZA. Well, that's a mercy, anyhow.  What I always say is--
[Sensation]	LIZA. Walk! Not bloody likely. . I am going in a taxi. [She goes out].
[rising]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  Well, after that, I think it's time for us to go.
[rising]	CLARA  Oh yes: we have three at homes to go to still. Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. Good-bye, Professor Higgins.
[convulsively]	MRS. EYNSFORD HILL  Clara!
[eagerly]	FREDDY  Yes, I should, most awfully.
[eagerly]	HIGGINS  Well? Is Eliza presentable [he swoops on his mother and drags her to the ottoman, where she sits down in Eliza's place with her son on her left]?
[aggrieved]	HIGGINS  Do you mean that my language is improper?
[sulkily]	HIGGINS  Oh, well, if you say so, I suppose I don't always talk like a bishop.
[slowly]	PICKERING  I think I know what you mean, Mrs. Higgins.
[fervently]	HIGGINS  Thank God it's over!
[Rising]	HIGGINS. Yes: that's what drives me mad: the silly people don't know their own silly business.  However, it's over and done with; and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.
[astounded]	HIGGINS  What on earth--! [He comes to her]. What's the matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?
[breathless]	LIZA  Nothing wrong--with YOU. I've won your bet for you, haven't I? That's enough for you. _I_ don't matter, I suppose.
[thundering]	HIGGINS  THOSE slippers.
[impatiently]	HIGGINS  Well, don't you thank God it's all over? Now you are free and can do what you like.
[Chuckling]	HIGGINS. Oh, lots of things. What about your old idea of a florist's shop? Pickering could set you up in one: he's lots of money.  He'll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole in two hundred pounds. Why, six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you'll be all right. I must clear off to bed: I'm devilish sleepy. By the way, I came down for something: I forget what it was.
[furious]	HIGGINS  Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands]. If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets, unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains].
[pertly]	LIZA  You'd better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee; for she won't be told by me.
[formally]	HIGGINS  Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you; and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe. [He goes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door savagely].
[going]	THE PARLOR-MAID. Yes, maam .
[announcing]	THE PARLOR-MAID  Mr. Doolittle. [She withdraws].
[tolerantly]	DOOLITTLE  A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us: a little of both.
[amazed]	HIGGINS  Upstairs!!! Then I shall jolly soon fetch her downstairs. [He makes resolutely for the door].
[astonished]	PICKERING  But why? What did we do to her?
[ironically]	MRS. HIGGINS  Quite sure?
[impatiently]	HIGGINS  But she knew all about that. We didn't make speeches to her, if that's what you mean.
[furious]	HIGGINS  Is she, by George? Ho!
[remonstrating]	DOOLITTLE  Now, now, Henry Higgins! have some consideration for my feelings as a middle class man.
[choking]	HIGGINS  Am I-- [He can say no more].
[placidly]	MRS. HIGGINS  Yes, dear; but you'll sit down, won't you?
[impulsively]	PICKERING  No.
[trivially]	LIZA  Of course: that is his profession.
[continuing]	LIZA  It was just like learning to dance in the fashionable way: there was nothing more than that in it. But do you know what began my real education?
[laughing]	PICKERING  Why don't you slang back at him? Don't stand it. It would do him a lot of good.
[rising]	HIGGINS  Forgive! Will she, by George! Let her go. Let her find out how she can get on without us. She will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow.
[angrily]	LIZA  You're going to let yourself down to marry that low common woman!
[quietly]	PICKERING  He ought to, Eliza. [To Doolittle] Why has she changed her mind?
[sadly]	DOOLITTLE  Intimidated, Governor. Intimidated. Middle class morality claims its victim. Won't you put on your hat, Liza, and come and see me turned off?
[rising]	MRS. HIGGINS  I'll order the carriage and get ready. [The men rise, except Higgins]. I shan't be more than fifteen minutes. [As she goes to the door Eliza comes in, hatted and buttoning her gloves]. I'm going to the church to see your father married, Eliza. You had better come in the brougham with me. Colonel Pickering can go on with the bridegroom.
[coaxing]	PICKERING  Do stay with us, Eliza. [He follows Doolittle].
[irritated]	HIGGINS  The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.
[earnestly]	LIZA  Don't you try to get round me. You'll HAVE to do without me.
[arrogant]	HIGGINS  I can do without anybody. I have my own soul: my own spark of divine fire. But [with sudden humility] I shall miss you, Eliza. [He sits down near her on the ottoman]. I have learnt something from your idiotic notions: I confess that humbly and gratefully. And I have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like them, rather.
[heartily]	HIGGINS  Why, because it was my job.
[gently]	HIGGINS  Than he is: not "than what he is."
[reflectively]	HIGGINS  I don't suppose Pickering would, though. He's as confirmed an old bachelor as I am.
[desperate]	LIZA  Oh, you are a cruel tyrant. I can't talk to you: you turn everything against me: I'm always in the wrong. But you know very well all the time that you're nothing but a bully. You know I can't go back to the gutter, as you call it, and that I have no real friends in the world but you and the Colonel. You know well I couldn't bear to live with a low common man after you two; and it's wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could. You think I must go back to Wimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but father's. But don't you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down. I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he's able to support me.
[disdainfully]	LIZA  Buy them yourself. [She sweeps out].
[sunnily]	HIGGINS  Oh, don't bother. She'll buy em all right enough. Good-bye.
[counting]	Nora . Ten shillings--a pound--two pounds! Thank you, thank you, Torvald; that will keep me going for a long time.
[smiling]	Helmer . Indeed it is--that is to say, if you were really to save out of the money I give you, and then really buy something for yourself. But if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things, then I merely have to pay up again.
[laughing]	Helmer . That's very true,--all you can. But you can't save anything!
[smiling]	Helmer . But there was precious little result, Nora.
[doubtfully]	Nora . How do you do--Mrs. Linde. You don't recognise me, I suppose.
[Suddenly.]	Nora. No, I don't know--yes, to be sure, I seem to-- Yes! Christine! Is it really you?
[gently]	Nora . Poor Christine, you are a widow.
[smiling]	Mrs. Linde . Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our schooldays you were a great spendthrift.
[laughing]	Nora . Yes, that is what Torvald says now. (Wags her finger at her.) But "Nora, Nora" is not so silly as you think. We have not been in a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.
[rising]	Nora . Oh, don't be angry with me!
[smiling]	Mrs. Linde . My dear! Small household cares and that sort of thing!--You are a child, Nora.
[smiling]	Nora . Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think, but--
[contemptuously]	Nora . In the Lottery? There would have been no credit in that.
[Smiles.]	Nora. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits' end.  Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me--
[rising]	Mrs. Linde . There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.
[sadly]	Mrs. Linde . Ah!
[rising]	Nora . My husband is out, Mr. Krogstad.
[Sobbing.]	Nora. It would be perfectly infamous of you.  To think of his learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly, clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a horribly disagreeable position--
[impetuously]	Nora . Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you certainly won't keep your post then.
[sewing]	Mrs. Linde . So you are going to be dressed up tomorrow Nora. I will tell you what--I shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers. But I have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday.
[breathlessly]	Nora . Torvald--what was that letter?
[rising]	Rank . You are a greater rascal than I thought.
[smiling]	Nora . I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.
[sadly]	Nora . Is that it?
[Exit.]	Maid. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. 
[faintly]	Nora . No more had I.
[quickly]	Nora . He mustn't get the letter. Tear it up. I will find some means of getting money.
[listening]	Mrs. Linde . Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!
[listening]	Mrs. Linde . You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we are not safe a moment longer.
[starting]	Nora . Did you hear--?
[outside]	Rank . It is I. May I come in for a moment?
[absently]	Nora . Maybe. (HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket and goes into the hall.) Torvald! what are you going to do there?
[quickly]	Nora . Then it must have been the children--
[reeling]	Helmer . True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No, no--it is impossible that it can be true.
[undisturbed]	Nora . I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste, and so I got the same tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made nothing of my life.
[sadly]	Helmer . I see, I see. An abyss has opened between us--there is no denying it. But, Nora, would it not be possible to fill it up?

[smiling]	Mrs. Stockmann . Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are spendthrifts.
[Listens.]	Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do.  I fancy I hear him coming now.
[Listens.]	Mrs. Stockmann. What nonsense! You and Thomas get on so capitally together.  There he is at last, I think. (Goes out and opens the door leading to the hall.)
[Calls.]	Dr. Stockmann. I know, I know; it is all cramped enough here, compared with many other places. But there is life here--there is promise--there are innumerable things to work for and fight for; and that is the main thing.  Katherine, hasn't the postman been here?
[laughing]	Billing . That's capital!
[laughing]	Petra . Thank you very much; but I am afraid nothing will come of it.
[slyly]	Morten Kiil . Is it--is it true?
[Stops.]	Hovstad. Good morning!  Oh, I beg your pardon
[laughing]	Dr. Stockmann . Just imagine--the old chap doesn't believe a word of all this about the water supply.
[bowing]	Aslaksen . Excuse my taking the liberty, Doctor--
[amazed]	Dr. Stockmann . No right?
[shouting]	Dr. Stockmann . You forbid--! You! A pack of--
[spitting]	Billing . Bah! That turncoat.
[writing]	Hovstad . Are you so sure he has got anything?
[writing]	Hovstad . Quite so, quite so.
[smiling]	Hovstad . Thank you for having such a good opinion of me. No; as a matter of fact that is Billing's idea and not mine.
[angrily]	Hovstad . Ahem!--there it is on the desk.
[writing]	Hovstad . Already, Doctor? Hurry up with what we were speaking about, Aslaksen. We are very pressed for time today.
[laughing]	Dr. Stockmann . Ha-ha!--just let them try! No, no--they will take good care not to. I have got the compact majority behind me, let me tell you!
[hurriedly]	Aslaksen . Yes, he ran away, Doctor.
[composedly]	Dr. Stockmann . And I have all these influences against me?
[angrily]	Dr. Stockmann . I will tell you why. It is because all the men in this town are old women--like you; they all think of nothing but their families, and never of the community.
[writing]	Billing , "Mr. Aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm."
[impatiently]	Dr. Stockmann . Not permit--! What the devil--!
[coughing]	Mrs. Stockmann . Ahem!-ahem!
[aside]	Peter Stockmann . What is coming now?
[continuing]	Dr. Stockmann . I have thought and pondered a great deal, these last few days--pondered over such a variety of things that in the end my head seemed too full to hold them--
[shouting]	A number of voices . Don't talk about the Baths! We won't hear you! None of that!
[Uproar.]	Dr. Stockmann. It is a petty thing to catch me up on a word, Mr. Aslaksen. What I mean is only that I got scent of the unbelievable piggishness our leading men had been responsible for down at the Baths. I can't stand leading men at any price!--I have had enough of such people in my time. They are like billy-goats on a young plantation; they do mischief everywhere. They stand in a free man's way, whichever way he turns, and what I should like best would be to see them exterminated like any other vermin--. 
[angrily]	A number of voices . Oho!--we are not the People! Only the superior folk are to govern, are they!
[shouting]	Hovstad . Prove it, Dr. Stockmann! When have I said so in print?
[reflecting]	Dr. Stockmann . No, confound it, you are right!--you have never had the courage to. Well, I won't put you in a hole, Mr. Hovstad. Let us say it is I that am the freethinker, then. I am going to prove to you, scientifically, that the "People's Messenger" leads you by the nose in a shameful manner when it tells you that you--that the common people, the crowd, the masses, are the real essence of the People. That is only a newspaper lie, I tell you! The common people are nothing more than the raw material of which a People is made. (Groans, laughter and uproar.) Well, isn't that the case? Isn't there an enormous difference between a well-bred and an ill-bred strain of animals? Take, for instance, a common barn-door hen. What sort of eating do you get from a shrivelled up old scrag of a fowl like that? Not much, do you! And what sort of eggs does it lay? A fairly good crow or a raven can lay pretty nearly as good an egg. But take a well-bred Spanish or Japanese hen, or a good pheasant or a turkey--then you will see the difference. Or take the case of dogs, with whom we humans are on such intimate terms. Think first of an ordinary common cur--I mean one of the horrible, coarse-haired, low-bred curs that do nothing but run about the streets and befoul the walls of the houses. Compare one of these curs with a poodle whose sires for many generations have been bred in a gentleman's house, where they have had the best of food and had the opportunity of hearing soft voices and music. Do you not think that the poodle's brain is developed to quite a different degree from that of the cur? Of course it is. It is puppies of well-bred poodles like that, that showmen train to do incredibly clever tricks--things that a common cur could never learn to do even if it stood on its head. (Uproar and mocking cries.)
[imperturbably]	Dr. Stockmann .--and that, not because he is like myself, descended from some old rascal of a pirate from Pomerania or thereabouts--because that is who we are descended from--
[Laughter.]	Hovstad. So it is only the distinguished men that are liberal-minded in this country? We are learning something quite new! 
[angrily]	Voices . Hear, hear! Quite right! Make him sit down!
[shouting]	The whole crowd . Yes, yes! He is an enemy of the people! He hates his country! He hates his own people!
[together]	The Citizens . Ah!--then it is easy to understand how it is!
[shouting]	Aslaksen . That is a blasphemous comparison, Dr. Stockmann!
[excitedly]	Other Voices . Let's go and break his windows! Duck him in the fjord!
[smiling]	Horster . Yes, that's just it.
[smiling]	Dr. Stockmann . Dared not? I seem to have heard that word before, today.
[composedly]	Dr. Stockmann . Come to the point, gentlemen. What do you want?
[irresolutely]	Aslaksen . If only I knew the way about here--. (Steals out through the sitting-room.)

[Mutters.]	REGINA.  Pleasant journey to you!
[Open-mouthed.]	REGINA.  You want me--? What are you talking about?
[Scornfully.]	REGINA.  Never in this world shall you get me home with you.
[Mimics.]	ENGSTRAND. And besides, it was when your mother was that aggravating--I had to find something to twit her with, my child. She was always setting up for a fine lady.  "Let me go, Engstrand; let me be. Remember I was three years in Chamberlain Alving's family at Rosenvold." [Laughs.] Mercy on us! She could never forget that the Captain was made a Chamberlain while she was in service here.
[Contemptuously.]	REGINA.  You've tried that often enough, and much good you've done with it.
[Stamps.]	REGINA.  Stop your swearing!
[Nearer.]	ENGSTRAND. But there must be a petticoat in the house; that's as clear as daylight. For I want to have it a bit lively like in the evenings, with singing and dancing, and so on. You must remember they're weary wanderers on the ocean of life.  Now don't be a fool and stand in your own light, Regina. What's to become of you out here? Your mistress has given you a lot of learning; but what good is that to you? You're to look after the children at the new Orphanage, I hear. Is that the sort of thing for you, eh? Are you so dead set on wearing your life out for a pack of dirty brats?
[Rising.]	MANDERS.  Yes, yes, certainly, Miss Engstrand.
[Quickly.]	MANDERS.  I left it down at the inn. I shall sleep there to-night.
[Rising.]	MANDERS.  My dear lady, don't take the matter so warmly. You sadly misjudge poor Engstrand. You seem to be quite terrified--
[Staring.]	MANDERS.  Ah--! How strange--!
[Protesting.]	MANDERS.  My dear young friend--
[Beaming.]	MRS. ALVING.  Yes, isn't it, dear?
[Continuing.]	MANDERS.  How can the authorities tolerate such things! Allow them to go on in the light of day! [Confronting MRS. ALVING.] Had I not cause to be deeply concerned about your son? In circles where open immorality prevails, and has even a sort of recognised position--!
[Silence.]	
[Moved.]	MANDERS.  And you were able to bear all this!
[Agitated.]	MANDERS.  What can be the matter? What is it, Mrs. Alving?
[Hoarsely.]	MRS. ALVING.  Ghosts! The couple from the conservatory--risen again!
[Outside.]	REGINA.  Yes, Mrs. Alving?
[Distantly.]	MANDERS.  Had I understood anything of the kind, I should not have been a daily guest in your husband's house.
[Quickly.]	MRS. ALVING.  Mr. Manders!
[Reassuringly.]	MANDERS.  Please allow me--
[Uncertain.]	ENGSTRAND.  Well--h'm--your Reverence knows all about me and poor Johanna.
[Anxiously.]	MRS. ALVING.  Well?
[Rising.]	MRS. ALVING.  Now you must tell me everything, Oswald!
[Sadly.]	OSWALD.  I thought so too, at first; but it isn't so.
[Breathlessly.]	MRS. ALVING.  What did he mean by that?
[Eagerly.]	OSWALD.  Is that true, mother? Do you mean it?
[Rising.]	MRS. ALVING.  What do you mean by that?
[Sits.]	OSWALD.  I daresay you don't know, mother, that I owe Regina some reparation.
[Starts.]	MRS. ALVING.  The joy of life? Can there be salvation in that?
[Rising.]	OSWALD.  Mother, I don't understand you.
[Involuntarily.]	REGINA.  Here!
[Listening.]	REGINA.  Oh, ma'am, listen! Don't you hear shouts outside. [She goes into the conservatory and looks out.]
[Softly.]	ENGSTRAND. Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting, you see.  The bird's limed, my girl. [Aloud.] And to think it should be my doing that such a thing should be his Reverence's doing!
[Stops.]	MANDERS.  So you declare. But I certainly cannot recollect that I ever had a candle in my hand.
[Nervously.]	OSWALD.  No, no--not to sleep! I never sleep. I only pretend to. [Sadly.] That will come soon enough.
[Eagerly.]	REGINA.  Is Mr. Alving ill?
[Impatiently.]	OSWALD.  Oh, do shut all the doors! This killing dread--
[Smiles.]	OSWALD. You?  No, mother; that rescue you will never bring me. [Laughs sadly.] You! ha ha! [Looks earnestly at her.] Though, after all, who ought to do it if not you? [Impetuously.] Why can't you say "thou" to me, Regina? [Note: "Sige du" = Fr. _tutoyer_] Why don't you call me "Oswald"?
[Softly.]	REGINA.  I don't think Mrs. Alving would like it.
[Slowly.]	MRS. ALVING.  I saw only this one thing: that your father was a broken-down man before you were born.
[Softly.]	OSWALD.  Ah--! [He rises and walks away to the window.]
[Impatiently.]	OSWALD. Oh, "father,"--"father"! I never knew anything of father. I remember nothing about him, except that he once made me sick.
[Wildly.]	MRS. ALVING.  Oswald--then you don't love me, either!
[Impatiently.]	OSWALD.  Yes yes yes; all these are just so many phrases. You must remember that I am a sick man, mother. I can't be much taken up with other people; I have enough to do thinking about myself.
[Shrieks.]	MRS. ALVING.  Oswald!
[Smiling.]	 H'm--wouldn't you like to know! [With emotion.] Ah, dear dear--if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now, and see what his little boy has grown into! [Looks around.] But bless me, Berta--why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the furniture.
[Laughing.]	 Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for them--in the course of time.
[Laughing.]	 Passably! Come, that's good, Hedda! You were sleeping like a stone when I got up.
[Interrupting.]	 We shall never get on with this servant, Tesman.
[Pointing.]	 Look there! She has left her old bonnet lying about on a chair.
[Following.]	 Yes, but have you noticed what splendid condition she is in? How she has filled out on the journey?
[Laughing.]	 Oh, that didn't last long; and it was before I met you, Hedda. But fancy her being in town!
[Pointing.]	That lady, ma'am, that brought some flowers a little while ago, is here again.  The flowers you have in your hand, ma'am.
[Rising.]	 You ought to write to him, Tesman. Perhaps he may not care to come to you of his own accord.
[Imploringly.]	 Oh, if you only would!
[Confused.]	 About the same thing?
[Apprehensively.]	 But there is nothing more, Mrs. Tesman! Absolutely nothing!
[Sadly.]	 Yes, I did.
[Lightly.]	 Eilert Lovborg has been in your neighbourhood about three years, hasn't he?
[Evasively.]	 I am sure he means well in everything.
[Irritably.]	 Yes, that is true, too. Everything about him is repellent to me! We have not a thought in common. We have no single point of sympathy--he and I.
[Eagerly.]	 Comrades! Yes, fancy, Hedda--that is the very word he used!--Oh, I ought to feel perfectly happy; and yet I cannot; for I don't know how long it will last.
[Gloomily.]	 A woman's shadow stands between Eilert Lovborg and me.
[Bowing.]	 Ah--delighted--
[Aghast.]	 The saddle-horse!
[Beaming.]	 Oh thank heaven for that! What is it, Hedda. Eh?
[Nearer.]	 Are you out of your senses--!
[Sympathetically.]	 Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
[Laughing.]	 Well, I can't answer for all the rest; but as for myself, you know quite well that I have always entertained a--a certain respect for the marriage tie--for marriage as an institution, Mrs. Hedda.
[Jestingly.]	 Oh, I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with respect to you.
[Bowing.]	 Frankly--of the mistress first of all; but of course of the master too, in the second place. Such a triangular friendship--if I may call it so--is really a great convenience for all the parties, let me tell you.
[Laughing.]	 To look at your ankles, do you mean?
[Rising.]	 I came in through the garden.
[Laughing.]	 Oh fie, Mrs. Hedda! Well, then--you and Tesman--?
[Laughing.]	 No, I think it must be a legacy from the late Mrs. Secretary Falk.
[Laughing.]	 Tesman? No really now, political life is not the thing for him--not at all in his line.
[Smiling.]	No, no, I daresay not. But suppose now that what people call--in elegant language--a solemn responsibility were to come upon you?  A new responsibility, Mrs. Hedda?
[Angrily.]	 Be quiet! Nothing of that sort will ever happen!
[Warily.]	 We will speak of this again a year hence--at the very outside.
[Curtly.]	 I have no turn for anything of the sort, Judge Brack. No responsibilities for me!
[Smiling.]	 And that would perhaps be the safest plan for him.
[Softly.]	 I'm sure it is he! Fancy that!
[Interposing.]	 But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper with me.
[Lightly.]	Ah--  I saw her for a moment this morning.
[Curtly.]	 Our way? Pray leave me out of the question.
[Smilingly.]	I wonder if there was? To me it seems as though we were two good comrades--two thoroughly intimate friends.  You especially were frankness itself.
[Eagerly.]	 Well?
[Laughing.]	 Then I, poor creature, have no sort of power over you?
[Softly.]	 Oh please, Hedda--!
[Joyfully.]	 Yes, let them!
[Surprised.]	 Distraction!
[Terrified.]	 Hedda--oh Hedda--!
[Imploringly.]	 Oh, my dearest friend--only let me tell you--
[Softly.]	 Oh, Hedda, Hedda--how could you do this?
[Rising.]	 Mine too, Judge Brack.
[Laughing.]	 I should not advise the fair lady to try it.
[Bowing.]	 About ten o'clock, then,
[Softly.]	 Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.
[Rising.]	 No one has come.
[Laughing.]	And then, you see, Tesman hasn't cared to come home and ring us up in the middle of the night.  Perhaps he wasn't inclined to show himself either--immediately after a jollification.
[Turns.]	 Hedda! [Approaching her.] Good heavens--are you up so early? Eh?
[Lightly.]	Yes, yes--I suppose it depends on that-- But, by-the-bye --here is a letter for you.
[Approaching.]	 You seem to have made a particularly lively night of it at your rooms, Judge Brack.
[Smiling.]	 George Tesman is really an ingenuous creature, Mrs. Hedda.
[Rising.]	 Oh, not at all! The triangle, you know, ought, if possible, to be spontaneously constructed.
[Rising.]	 Are you going through the garden?
[Involuntarily.]	 I knew it!
[Despairingly.]	 Then what am I to do with my life?
[Shrieks.]	 Oh no, no--!
[Involuntarily.]	 But that's not--
[Smiling.]	Beautifully?  With vine-leaves in my hair, as you used to dream in the old days--?
[Continuing.]	 Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but of another sort, thank God!
[Uneasily.]	 Oh nothing. It will all come right. Let us hope so--eh?
[Smiling.]	Well well, I daresay you two want to talk to each other.  And perhaps Hedda may have something to tell you too, George. Good-bye! I must go home to Rina. [Turning at the door.] How strange it is to think that now Rina is with me and with my poor brother as well!
[Quickly.]	 Is there anything new about him?
[Quickly.]	No.  Did you tell Mrs. Elvsted?
[Shrieks.]	 Oh God! oh God--!
[Involuntarily.]	 So soon then--
[Wailing.]	 And we parted in anger, Hedda!
[Whispers.]	 Thea--Thea--be careful!
[Evasively.]	 Oh, nothing--nothing.
[Curtly.]	 Through one of the police. A man I had some business with.
[Terrified.]	 Good heavens, Hedda! what are you saying?
[Starting.]	 The manuscript? Has he torn that up?
[Smiling.]	 H'm--my dear Mrs. Hedda--
[Breathless.]	 Well? What of it?
[Quickly.]	If you like.  No, wait! Let me clear it first!
[Whispers.]	 What did you say about the pistol?
[Softly.]	 That he must have stolen it.
[Firmly.]	 Death rather than that.
[Smiling.]	 People say such things--but they don't do them.
[Languidly_._]	Algernon.    I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
[Stiffly_._]	Algernon.    I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?
[Airily_._]	Jack.    Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
[Sententiously.]	Jack.    That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.
[Gravely.]	Lane.    There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.
[Frowning.]	Lady Bracknell.    I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
[Nervously.]	Jack.    Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.
[Glibly.]	Gwendolen.    Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
[Astounded.]	Jack.    Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
[Reproachfully.]	Gwendolen.    Mamma!
[Sternly.]	Lady Bracknell.    Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your politics?
[Gravely.]	Jack.    In a hand-bag.
[Irritably.]	Jack.    Oh!  It always is nearly seven.
[Calling.]	Miss Prism.    Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  We will repeat yesterday's lesson.
[Smiling.]	Cecily.    But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.
[Bowing.]	Chasuble.    A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?
[Sententiously.]	Miss Prism.    That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.  And you do not seem to realise, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.
[Bitterly.]	Miss Prism.    People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.
[Nervously.]	Algernon.  Yes, of course.  
[Rising.]	Cecily.    I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided attention.
[Severely.]	Gwendolen.    Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?
[Inquiringly.]	Gwendolen.    I beg your pardon?
[Meditatively.]	Gwendolen.    If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm hand.
[Satirically.]	Gwendolen.    I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
[Sweetly.]	Cecily.    I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]
[Sweetly.]	Cecily.    Sugar?
[Superciliously.]	Gwendolen.    No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable any more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.]
[Severely.]	Cecily.    Cake or bread and butter?
[Rising.]	Cecily.    To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.
[Laughing.]	Jack.    To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
[Receding.]	Gwendolen.    Jack!  Oh!
[Laughing.]	Algernon.    Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
[Surprised.]	Cecily.    No brother at all?
[Cheerily.]	Jack.    None!
[Severely.]	Gwendolen.    Had you never a brother of any kind?
[Pleasantly.]	Jack.    Never.  Not even of any kind.
[Rising.]	Algernon.  When I am in trouble, eating is the only thing that consoles me.  Indeed, when I am in really great trouble, as any one who knows me intimately will tell you, I refuse everything except food and drink.  At the present moment I am eating muffins because I am unhappy.  Besides, I am particularly fond of muffins.  
[Rising.]	Jack.    Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]
[Stammering.]	Algernon.    Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury is somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.
[Airily.]	Algernon.    Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.
[Grimly.]	Lady Bracknell.    I have known strange errors in that publication.
[Starting.]	Lady Bracknell.    Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
[Severely.]	Chasuble.    I am a celibate, madam.
[Interposing.]	Jack.    Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.
[Calmly.]	Miss Prism.    It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And here, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly mine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
[Amazed.]	Miss Prism.    You?
[Irritably.]	Jack.    Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?
[Meditatively.]	Lady Bracknell.    I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one. He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.
[Enthusiastically.]	Miss Prism.    Frederick!  At last!
[_Languidly_.]	LADY BASILDON.    And were you interested?
[_Rising_.]	MRS. MARCHMONT.    And how well it becomes us, Olivia!
[_Smiling_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.
[_Gravely_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.    I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!
[_Genially_.]	LADY MARKBY.    Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don’t they?  It is most fashionable.  [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.] Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?
[_Superciliously_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY   Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.
[_Coldly_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    I am not surprised!
[_Bowing_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about nothing else.
[_Smiling_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?
[_Rises_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.  Later on.    And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim—you remember the Baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.
[_Smiling_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    Intimately.  Did you?
[_Bowing_.]	LORD GORING.    I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.
[_Approaching_.]	VICOMTE DE NANJAC.    Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.
[_Severely_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.    The music is in German.  You would not understand it.
[_Emphatically_.]	LADY BASILDON.    Yes, always to others, have we not?
[_Smiling_.]	LORD GORING.    And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London.
[_Stiffly_.]	LADY BASILDON.    Please don’t praise other women in our presence.  You might wait for us to do that!
[_Coldly_.]	LADY BASILDON.    I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte. [_The_ VICOMTE _is about to retire_.  LADY BASILDON, _seeing this_, _rises at once and takes his arm_.]  But I will come down with you with pleasure.
[_Languidly_.]	MRS. MARCHMONT.    Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.  [_Rises hastily and takes his arm_.]  But I will sit beside you, and watch you.
[_Severely_.]	MRS. MARCHMONT.    Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public!
[_Frowning_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Ah! yes.  I remember hearing, at the time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.
[_Rising_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    But you have not seen my Corots yet. They are in the music-room.  Corots seem to go with music, don’t they? May I show them to you?
[_Coldly_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Pray allow me to believe that you are not.
[_Contemptuously_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    The letter you wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Radley’s secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal shares—a letter written three days before the Government announced its own purchase.
[_Hoarsely_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    It is not true.
[_Gently_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    A secret?  Between whom?
[_Entering_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Your carriage is here, Mrs. Cheveley!
[_Eagerly_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.    Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it all the evening.
[_Exit_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.  Then I shall certainly bid you good-night.  Good-night, Gertrude!  
[_Exit_]	
[_Starting_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Who told you I intended to do so?
[_Sadly_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    One’s past is what one is.  It is the only way by which people should be judged.
[_Stopping_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    In the present case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is all.
[_Sternly_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Yes!
[_Slowly_.]	LORD GORING.    Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There is no doubt of that.
[_Bitterly_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Men who every day do something of the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their own lives.
[_Excitedly_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    I did not sell myself for money.  I bought success at a great price.  That is all.
[_Gravely_.]	LORD GORING.    Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?
[_Rising_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.
[_Sadly_.]	LORD GORING.    You thought you had won.
[_Airily_.]	LORD GORING.    Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter. By the way, have you tried her with money?  She used to be confoundedly fond of money.
[_Writing_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Why do you say that?
[_Smiling_.]	LORD GORING.    I wonder.
[_Strongly_.]	LORD GORING.    Oh, fight in any case—in any case.
[_Smiling_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Of which you know so little, Lord Goring—
[_Gravely_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    I hope so.  Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring?
[_Rising_.]	LORD GORING.    No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist. Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.  All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.  If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at once to me.
[_Laughing_.]	LORD GORING.    You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.  It won’t occur again, if I can help it.
[_Smiling_.]	LORD GORING.    I am not so sure.
[_Triumphantly_.]	MABEL CHILTERN   I am.
[_Rising_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Mrs. Cheveley!  Coming to see me? Impossible!
[_Reflecting_.]	LADY MARKBY.    You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A little too modern, perhaps.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  I have known many instances of it.
[_Smiling_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY   No, lady Markby—a ruby.
[_Coldly_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That will do, Mason.  You can bring tea.
[_Languidly_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY   I have never read a Blue Book.  I prefer books . . . in yellow covers.
[_Rising_.]	LADY MARKBY.  Well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of happiness, as no doubt you noticed.  But there are many tragedies in her family, besides this affair of the curate.  Her own sister, Mrs. Jekyll, had a most unhappy life; through no fault of her own, I am sorry to say. She ultimately was so broken-hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the operatic stage, I forget which.  No; I think it was decorative art-needlework she took up.  I know she had lost all sense of pleasure in life.    And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.  Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn’t mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.  As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I shan’t stay long.
[_Rising_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY   I don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one.
[_Rising_.]	LADY CHILTERN   Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheveley will stay here a little.  I should like to have a few minutes’ conversation with her.
[_Contemptuously_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Like the service you wished to render my husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him from that.
[_Apologetically_.]	LORD GORING.    Quite so, father.  I was merely expressing sympathy.
[_Indignantly_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    If you listen attentively! . . . Conceited young puppy!
[_Gravely_.]	PHIPPS.    Thank you, madam.
[_Expostulating_.]	LORD GORING.    My dear father, if I am to get married, surely you will allow me to choose the time, place, and person? Particularly the person.
[_Testily_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    That is a matter for me, sir.  You would probably make a very poor choice.  It is I who should be consulted, not you.  There is property at stake.  It is not a matter for affection. Affection comes later on in married life.
[_Exit_.]	PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  
[_Rises_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    Arthur, let me see for myself.
[_Smiling_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    To-morrow.
[_Rising_.]	LORD GORING.    The Book of Numbers.
[_Bitterly_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    I only war against one woman, against Gertrude Chiltern.  I hate her.  I hate her now more than ever.
[_Calmly_.]	LORD GORING.    Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it.
[_Starting_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    What do you mean?
[_Trembling_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    The police?  What for?
[_Laughing_.]	MRS. CHEVELEY.    ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’
[_Bowing_.]	JAMES.    I shall do so, my lord.
[_Genially_.]	LORD GORING.    Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
[_Caustically_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    You can have till dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you.
[_Airily_.]	LORD GORING.    The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.
[_Testily_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.
[_Sadly_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.    Then I suppose it is my duty to remain with you?
[_Rapturously_.]	MABEL CHILTERN.    Oh! is it a proposal?
[_Indignantly_.]	LORD GORING.    The second to-day?  What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you?
[_Enthusiastically_.]	LORD GORING.    How sweet of you to say so! . . . And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully extravagant.
[_Triumphantly_.]	LORD GORING.    No; that was a flash of genius.
[_Bowing_.]	LORD GORING.    Good morning, Lady Chiltern!
[_Rising_.]	LORD GORING.    Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with you. Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband.
[_Rising_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Oh, I couldn’t, I couldn’t!
[_Gravely_.]	LORD GORING.    You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.
[_Eagerly_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.  It is your duty to do that.
[_Sadly_.]	SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.    And your ambition for me?  You used to be ambitious for me.
[_Angrily_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and retire from public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.  Chiltern, I beg your pardon.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Don’t grin like that, sir.
[_Grimly_.]	LORD CAVERSHAM.    Not a subject on which much eloquence is possible.
[_Startled_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    I don’t understand you.
[_Smiling_.]	LADY CHILTERN.    No; you shall have Mabel.  [_Takes the letter and writes her husband’s name on it_.]
[_Smiling_.]	LORD DARLINGTON.    Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only things we _can_ pay.
[_Gravely_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that. But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes think you pretend to be worse.
[_Smiling_.]	LORD DARLINGTON.    Oh, anything is better than being sacrificed!
[_Frowning_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Console herself?
[_R.C._]	LORD DARLINGTON.    Oh, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.  I should never be admitted!  [_Sitting_.]
[_Smiling_.]	LORD DARLINGTON.    Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and exit C._]
[_Rises_.]	LADY AGATHA.  Yes, mamma.  
[_Smiling_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Why, Duchess?
[_Interrupting_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Duchess, Duchess, it’s impossible! [_Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.  Our child is but six months old.  [_Sits in chair R. of L. table_.]
[_Rises_.]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.  Yes, we begin like that.  It was only Berwick’s brutal and incessant threats of suicide that made me accept him at all, and before the year was out, he was running after all kinds of petticoats, every colour, every shape, every material.  In fact, before the honeymoon was over, I caught him winking at my maid, a most pretty, respectable girl.  I dismissed her at once without a character.—No, I remember I passed her on to my sister; poor dear Sir George is so short-sighted, I thought it wouldn’t matter.  But it did, though—it was most unfortunate.    And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out.  And mind you don’t take this little aberration of Windermere’s too much to heart.  Just take him abroad, and he’ll come back to you all right.
[_C._]	LADY WINDERMERE.  Come back to me?  
[_L.C._]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.     Yes, dear, these wicked women get our husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of course.  And don’t make scenes, men hate them!
[_Rises_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a house for her?
[_L._]	LADY WINDERMERE.  Rather curious, isn’t it?  
[_L.C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Margaret, I was saying to you—and I beg you to listen to me—that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has conducted herself well.  If years ago—
[_C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.    I am not going to give you any details about her life.  I tell you simply this—Mrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.  She was well born, she had position—she lost everything—threw it away, if you like.  That makes it all the more bitter.  Misfortunes one can endure—they come from outside, they are accidents.  But to suffer for one’s own faults—ah!—there is the sting of life.  It was twenty years ago, too.  She was little more than a girl then.  She had been a wife for even less time than you have.
[_Rises_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.  You are mad!  
[_L.C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Margaret, you are talking foolishly, recklessly.  I won’t argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs. Erlynne to-night.
[_R.C._]	LADY WINDERMERE.    I shall do nothing of the kind.  [_Crossing L.C._]
[_C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.  You refuse?  
[_Coldly_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Yes, I have seen a good deal of her since then.  I have just seen her.
[_Aside_.]	LORD AUGUSTUS.  Egad! the women are very down on her.  I have been dining with Arabella this evening!  By Jove! you should have heard what she said about Mrs. Erlynne.  She didn’t leave a rag on her. . . .  Berwick and I told her that didn’t matter much, as the lady in question must have an extremely fine figure.  You should have seen Arabella’s expression! . . . But, look here, dear boy.  I don’t know what to do about Mrs. Erlynne.  Egad!  I might be married to her; she treats me with such demmed indifference.  She’s deuced clever, too!  She explains everything.  Egad! she explains you.  She has got any amount of explanations for you—and all of them different.
[_C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Margaret!  I _must_ speak to you.
[_R.C._]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both. Remember that!  Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her husband!
[_C._]	LADY WINDERMERE.    London is full of women who trust their husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly unhappy.  I am not going to be one of them.  [_Moves up_.]  Lord Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful thing a fan, isn’t it? . . . I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I didn’t know I would want one so soon.
[_C._]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!
[_Smiling_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    The wisest thing I ever did in my life. And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening. I am afraid of the women.  You must introduce me to some of them.  The men I can always manage.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  You have quite neglected me lately.  I have not seen you since yesterday.  I am afraid you’re faithless.  Every one told me so.
[_R._]	LORD AUGUSTUS.    Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.
[_R.C._]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    No, dear Lord Augustus, you can’t explain anything.  It is your chief charm.
[_R._]	LADY JEDBURGH.    Most kind of you to say these charming things to me!  [MRS. ERLYNNE _smiles_, _and continues conversation_.]
[_Rises_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.  No, no!  
[_Exit_.]	LORD DARLINGTON.  To-morrow I leave England.  This is the last time I shall ever look on you.  You will never see me again.  For one moment our lives met—our souls touched.  They must never meet or touch again. Good-bye, Margaret.  
[_C._]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.    Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?
[_Aside_.]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.    Did Mr. Hopper definitely—
[_Affectionately_.]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.    My dear one!  You always say the right thing.  Mr. Hopper!  James!  Agatha has told me everything. How cleverly you have both kept your secret.
[_Indignantly_.]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.    To Australia?  Oh, don’t mention that dreadful vulgar place.
[_Severely_.]	DUCHESS OF BERWICK.    Did you say that, Agatha?
[_Frowning_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?
[_Laughing_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Then we will talk of it on the terrace. Even business should have a picturesque background.  Should it not, Windermere?  With a proper background women can do anything.
[_Exit_.]	
[_Nervously_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.
[_Authoritatively_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Yes, you must!  There is not a second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
[_C._]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong your husband horribly.  He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
[_R._]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Never read it!
[_R.C._]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Your husband has never seen the letter.  I—saw it, I opened it.  I—read it.
[_Slowly_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    You took good care to burn it before I had examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could you speak the truth about anything?  [_Sits down_.]
[_Hurriedly_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Think as you like about me—say what you choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.
[_Sullenly_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    I do _not_ love him!
[_Rising_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Ah! you admit you have a hold!
[_Humbly_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Nothing.  I know it—but I tell you that your husband loves you—that you may never meet with such love again in your whole life—that such love you will never meet—and that if you throw it away, the day may come when you will starve for love and it will not be given to you, beg for love and it will be denied you—Oh! Arthur loves you!
[_Outside_.]	LORD AUGUSTUS.    Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not leave me!
[_Aside_.]	CECIL GRAHAM.  Come over here.  I want you particularly.   Darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love, and that sort of thing, and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time.
[_Chuckling_.]	LORD AUGUSTUS.    By Jove!  By Jove!
[_Smiling_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    It is some of your nonsense, Cecil.
[_Aside_.]	LORD DARLINGTON.    She is here after all!
[_Moves_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.  Speak, sir!  Why is my wife’s fan here?  Answer me!  By God!  I’ll search your rooms, and if my wife’s here, I’ll—  
[_Rising_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    She is sure to tell him.  I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly, nobly—and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.  Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange!  I would have publicly disgraced her in my own house.  She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women. . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us!  For even if she doesn’t tell, I must.  Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it.  To tell it is to live through it all again.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.  Words are perhaps the worst.  Words are merciless. . . . Oh! [_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]
[_Rises_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.  My dear child, you are not well.  You’ve been doing too much.  Let us go away to the country.  You’ll be all right at Selby.  The season is almost over.  There is no use staying on.  Poor darling!  We’ll go away to-day, if you like.    We can easily catch the 3.40. I’ll send a wire to Fannen.  [_Crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram_.]
[_Rising_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    It is too late, Arthur, to say that now. [_Moves away_.]
[_Rising_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.  It was absolutely shameless, the whole thing.
[_Returning_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    I’m afraid it is very flattering—I am not so pretty as that.  [_Showing photograph_.]
[_Coldly_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    My daughter, you mean.
[_Rising_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Do you count that to his credit, Lord Windermere—or to mine?
[_Rising_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    I suppose, Windermere, you would like me to retire into a convent, or become a hospital nurse, or something of that kind, as people do in silly modern novels.  That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don’t do such things—not as long as we have any good looks left, at any rate.  No—what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure.  Repentance is quite out of date.  And besides, if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.  And nothing in the world would induce me to do that.  No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives.  My coming into them has been a mistake—I discovered that last night.
[_Smiling_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Almost fatal.
[_Angrily_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    Then let me beg of you to leave our house at once.  I will make your excuses to Margaret.
[_Pause_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.  Yes.    You are devoted to your mother’s memory, Lady Windermere, your husband tells me.
[_Pause_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.  Yes.  
[_Rising_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere.
[_Rising_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Oh no, don’t.
[_Coldly_.]	LORD AUGUSTUS.    Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Erlynne.
[_Laughing_.]	MRS. ERLYNNE.    Of course I do.  You’ll carry it so gracefully.  You would carry off anything gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.
[_Gravely_.]	LORD WINDERMERE.    She is better than one thought her.
[_Frightened_.]	LADY WINDERMERE.    Has Mrs. Erlynne—?
[_Smiling_.]	HESTER.    We have the largest country in the world, Lady Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as France and England put together.
[_Exeunt_.]	SIR JOHN.  Certainly, my love.  
[_Exit_.]	
[_Continuing_.]	HESTER.    I couldn’t believe that any women could really hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your guests.  [_An awkward pause_.]
[_Slowly_.]	GERALD.    I suppose there is.
[_Laughing_.]	GERALD.    I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know how to talk.
[_Rising_.]	THE ARCHDEACON.    I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton. Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.
[_Rising_.]	LADY HUNSTANTON.    Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes with him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.
[_Exit_.]	GERALD.  If you really want to, of course, mother, but I must bid good-bye to Lord Illingworth first.  I’ll be back in five minutes. 
[_Outside_.]	HESTER.    Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in terror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]
[_Rising_.]	GERALD.    Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs. Allonby.
[_Rising_.]	LADY HUNSTANTON.    A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald.
[_Exeunt_.]	
[1]	On the production of "Salomé" by the New Stage Club in May, 1905, the dramatic critics again expressed themselves vehemently, vociferating their regrets that the play had been dragged from its obscurity. The obscure drama, however, had become for five years past part of the literature of Europe. It is performed regularly or intermittently in Holland, Sweden, Italy, France, and Russia, and it has been translated into every European language, including the Czech. It forms part of the repertoire of the German stage, where it is performed more often than any play by any English writer except Shakespeare. Owing, perhaps, to what I must call its _obscure_ popularity in the continental theatres, Dr. Strauss was preparing his remarkable opera at the very moment when there appeared the criticisms to which I refer, and since the production of the opera in Dresden in December, 1905, English musical journalists and correspondents always refer to the work as founded on Wilde's drama. That is the only way in which they can evade an awkward truth--a palpable contravention to their own wishes and theories. The music, however, has been set to the actual words of "Salomé" in Madame Hedwig Lachmann's admirable translation. The words have not been transfigured into ordinary operatic nonsense to suit the score, or the susceptibilities of the English people. I observe that admirers of Dr. Strauss are a little mortified that the great master should have found an occasion for composition in a play which they long ago consigned to oblivion and the shambles of Aubrey Beardsley. Wilde himself, in a rhetorical period, seems to have contemplated the possibility of his prose drama for a musical theme. In "De Profundis" he says: "The refrains, whose recurring motifs make 'Salomé' so like a piece of music, and bind it together as a ballad."
[1]	 A more recent performance of "Salomé" (1906), by the Literary Theatre Club, has again produced an ebullition of rancour and deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the dramatic critics, the majority of whom are anxious to parade their ignorance of the continental stage. The production was remarkable on account of the beautiful dresses and mounting, for which Mr. Charles Ricketts was responsible, and the marvellous impersonation of Herod by Mr. Robert Farquharson. Wilde used to say that "Salomé" was a mirror in which everyone could see himself. The artist, art; the dull, dulness; the vulgar, vulgarity.

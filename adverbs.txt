[Angrily]  So you haven't the money! And yet the workmen must be paid, mustn't they?
[Calls]  Shut the window, Uncle!
[Angrily]  You say to me: "Stop talking nonsense!" You are a good man and a clever one, but you haven't any red blood in your veins or any--well, enthusiasm. Why, if you wanted to, you and I could cut a dash together that would shame the devil himself. If you were a normal man instead of a morbid hypochondriac we would have a million in a year. For instance, if I had twenty-three hundred roubles now I could make twenty thousand in two weeks. You don't believe me? You think it is all nonsense? No, it isn't nonsense. Give me twenty-three hundred roubles and let me try. Ofsianoff is selling a strip of land across the river for that price. If we buy this, both banks will be ours, and we shall have the right to build a dam across the river. Isn't that so? We can say that we intend to build a mill, and when the people on the river below us hear that we mean to dam the river they will, of course, object violently and we shall say: If you don't want a dam here you will have to pay to get us away. Do you see the result? The factory would give us five thousand roubles, Korolkoff three thousand, the monastery five thousand more--
[Interrupting]  Oh, don't be coarse! [To LVOFF] It takes money to go to the Crimea, and even if I could afford it, you know she has refused to go.
[Sighing]  The life of man is like a flower, blooming so gaily in a field. Then, along comes a goat, he eats it, and the flower is gone!
[Yawning]  Everything is a fraud and a swindle. [A pause.]
[Thoughtfully]  It would cost a great deal for us both to go, and besides, I could not get leave to be away for so long. I have had one holiday already this year.
[Laughing]  Upon my word, that man is no scoundrel, but a great thinker, a master-mind. He deserves a memorial. He is the essence of modern ingenuity, and combines in himself alone the genius of the lawyer, the doctor, and the financier. [He sits down on the lowest step of the terrace] And yet he has never finished a course of studies in any college; that is so surprising. What an ideal scoundrel he would have made if he had acquired a little culture and mastered the sciences! "You could make twenty thousand roubles in a week," he said. "You still hold the ace of trumps: it is your title." [Laughing] He said I might get a rich girl to marry me for it! [ANNA opens the window and looks down] "Let me make a match between you and Martha," says he. Who is this Martha? It must be that Balabalkina--Babakalkina woman, the one that looks like a laundress.
[Laughing]  You can't even repeat the simplest saying without ill-nature. You are a most malicious old man. [Seriously] Seriously, Count you are extremely disagreeable, and very tiresome and painful to live with. You are always grumbling and growling, and everybody to you is a blackguard and a scoundrel. Tell me honestly, Count, have you ever spoken well of any one?
[Quietly]  Screaming again.
[Thoughtfully]  First I would go to Moscow to hear the Gipsies play, and then--then I should fly to Paris and take an apartment and go to the Russian Church.
[Excitedly]  Ivanoff, I have heard all you have to say and--and--I am going to speak frankly. You have shown me in your voice and manner, as well as in your words, the most heartless egotism and pitiless cruelty. Your nearest friend is dying simply because she is near you, her days are numbered, and you can feel such indifference that you go about giving advice and analysing your feelings. I cannot say all I should like to; I have not the gift of words, but--but I can at least say that you are deeply antipathetic to me.
[Listens]  I think I hear the carriage coming. I must get ready to go. [He goes toward the house and then stops] You dislike me, doctor, and you don't conceal it. Your sincerity does you credit. [He goes into the house.]
[Alone]  What a confoundedly disagreeable character! I have let another opportunity slip without speaking to him as I meant to, but I simply cannot talk calmly to that man. The moment I open my mouth to speak I feel such a commotion and suffocation here [He puts his hand on his breast] that my tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth. Oh, I loathe that Tartuffe, that unmitigated rascal, with all my heart! There he is, preparing to go driving in spite of the entreaties of his unfortunate wife, who adores him and whose only happiness is his presence. She implores him to spend at least one evening with her, and he cannot even do that. Why, he might shoot himself in despair if he had to stay at home! Poor fellow, what he wants are new fields for his villainous schemes. Oh, I know why you go to Lebedieff's every evening, Ivanoff! I know.
[Tearfully]  Nicholas, my dear boy, do please take me with you. I might possibly be amused a little by the sight of all the fools and scoundrels I should see there. You know I haven't been off this place since Easter.
[Exasperated]  Oh, very well! Come along then! How tiresome you all are!
[Excitedly]  Darling, sweetheart, my dear, unhappy one, I implore you to let me leave home in the evenings. I know it is cruel and unjust to ask this, but let me do you this injustice. It is such torture for me to stay. As soon as the sun goes down my soul is overwhelmed by the most horrible despair. Don't ask me why; I don't know; I swear I don't. This dreadful melancholy torments me here, it drives me to the Lebedieff's and there it grows worse than ever. I rush home; it still pursues me; and so I am tortured all through the night. It is breaking my heart.
[Laughing]  The flowers return with every spring, but lost happiness never returns. I wonder who taught me that? I think it was Nicholas himself. [Listens] The owl is hooting again.
[Sings] 
[laughing]  That is what he used to say, long ago, oh, exactly! Only his eyes are larger than yours, and when he was excited they used to shine like coals--go on, go on!
[Laughing]  I gave one look and was caught like a mouse in a trap! So when he asked me to go with him I cut every tie that bound me to my old life as one snips the withered leaves from a plant. But things are different now. Now he goes to the Lebedieff's to amuse himself with other women, and I sit here in the garden and listen to the owls. [The WATCHMAN'S rattle is heard] Tell me, Doctor, have you any brothers and sisters?
[Gaily]  My dearest Martha!
[Laughing]  Young people indeed! Do you call yourself an old person?
[Sighing]  How can I make any pretense to youth now?
[Aside]  Heavens! This is deadly! I shall die of ennui.
[Yawning]  Oh, dear, our sins are heavy! [He catches sight of MARTHA] Why, there is my little sugar-plum! How is your most esteemed highness?
[Yelling]  I said no-trumps, and not he!
[Furiously]  I'll be damned if I ever sit down to another game of cards with that old cat!
[Excitedly]  And what on earth can he do with her now? Where could she go if he were to come home some day and say: "Your parents have deceived me; leave my house at once!" Her parents wouldn't take her back. She might find a place as a house-maid if she had ever learned to work, which she hasn't. He worries and worries her now, but the Count interferes. If it had not been for the Count, he would have worried her to death long ago.
[Laughter.] 
[Horrified]  Nine thousand!
[Hotly]  Mamma, you have already discussed this subject at least a thousand times!
[Laughing]  That's right, Sasha! Give them a good scolding.
[Joyfully]  My dear Count!
[Calls]  Gabriel, bring some tea! Please sit down.
[Whispers]  Zuzu has frightened all the decent men away with her stingy ways, and now we have only this riff-raff, as you see: Tom, Dick, and Harry. However, drink your tea.
[Sighing]  I know it seems as if no one could be richer than we, but where do they think the money comes from? It is all gossip.
[Gaily]  Oh, rapture! Oh, bliss! I cannot look at you two without a madly beating heart!
[Angrily]  He shrieks like a parrot at every step: "Make way for honest endeavour!" and thinks himself another St. Francis. Everybody is a rascal who doesn't make as much noise as he does. As for his penetration, it is simply remarkable! If a peasant is well off and lives decently, he sees at once that he must be a thief and a scoundrel. If I wear a velvet coat and am dressed by my valet, I am a rascal and the valet is my slave. There is no place in this world for a man like him. I am actually afraid of him. Yes, indeed, he is likely, out of a sense of duty, to insult a man at any moment and to call him a knave.
[Laughing]  The life of the company! The moment he comes in the air fe els livelier. Have you noticed it?
[Startled]  Why, that is quite true! I never thought of it.
[Excitedly]  Wait a minute; really, Misha, these things aren't done in a second like this. If the Count wants to marry me, let him ask me himself, and--and--I don't see, I don't understand--all this is so sudden----
[Angrily]  How could I joke on such a serious subject?
[Laughing]  His head is small, but the great ideas are hidden away in it like fish in the sea!
[Sighing]  May one go and pay one's respects to her?
[Sighing]  The day she fainted at our house, on Sasha's birthday, I saw that she had not much longer to live, poor thing. Let me see, why did she faint? When I ran up, she was lying on the floor, ashy white, with Nicholas on his knees beside her, and Sasha was standing by them in tears. Sasha and I went about almost crazy for a week after that.
[Angrily]  Why does he tell such lies? Consumption! No hope! She is dying! It is nonsense, I can't abide him!
[Shrieks]  Bad luck to you, you nearly knocked me down.
[Bows]  How do you do, my son?
[Bitterly]  So you have turned my library into a bar-room again, have you? And yet I have begged you all a thousand times not to do so! [He goes up to the table] There, you see, you have spilt vodka all over my papers and scattered crumbs and cucumbers everywhere! It is disgusting!
[Startled]  My dear boy, I didn't know that! I wasn't thinking of him at all.
[Shrieks]  But she won't wait! [A pause.]
[Alone]  I am a worthless, miserable, useless man. Only a man equally miserable and suffering, as Paul is, could love or esteem me now. Good God! How I loathe myself! How bitterly I hate my voice, my hands, my thoughts, these clothes, each step I take! How ridiculous it is, how disgusting! Less than a year ago I was healthy and strong, full of pride and energy and enthusiasm. I worked with these hands here, and my words could move the dullest man to tears. I could weep with sorrow, and grow indignant at the sight of wrong. I could feel the glow of inspiration, and understand the beauty and romance of the silent nights which I used to watch through from evening until dawn, sitting at my worktable, and giving up my soul to dreams. I believed in a bright future then, and looked into it as trustfully as a child looks into its mother's eyes. And now, oh, it is terrible! I am tired and without hope; I spend my days and nights in idleness; I have no control over my feet or brain. My estate is ruined, my woods are falling under the blows of the axe. [He weeps] My neglected land looks up at me as reproachfully as an orphan. I expect nothing, am sorry for nothing; my whole soul trembles at the thought of each new day. And what can I think of my treatment of Sarah? I promised her love and happiness forever; I opened her eyes to the promise of a future such as she had never even dreamed of. She believed me, and though for five years I have seen her sinking under the weight of her sacrifices to me, and losing her strength in her struggles with her conscience, God knows she has never given me one angry look, or uttered one word of reproach. What is the result? That I don't love her! Why? Is it possible? Can it be true? I can't understand. She is suffering; her days are numbered; yet I fly like a contemptible coward from her white face, her sunken chest, her pleading eyes. Oh, I am ashamed, ashamed! [A pause] Sasha, a young girl, is sorry for me in my misery. She confesses to me that she loves me; me, almost an old man! Whereupon I lose my head, and exalted as if by music, I yell: "Hurrah for a new life and new happiness!" Next day I believe in this new life and happiness as little as I believe in my happiness at home. What is the matter with me? What is this pit I am wallowing in? What is the cause of this weakness? What does this nervousness come from? If my sick wife wounds my pride, if a servant makes a mistake, if my gun misses fire, I lose my temper and get violent and altogether unlike myself. I can't, I can't understand it; the easiest way out would be a bullet through the head!
[Angrily]  What are you after anyway? And with whom have I the honour of speaking? With my lawyer, or with my wife's doctor?
[Startled]  Oh, Sasha, is that you?
[Laughing]  I have noticed that whenever you start reforming me and saving my soul, and teaching me how to be good, your face grows naive, oh so naive, and your eyes grow as wide as if you were looking at a comet. Wait a moment; your shoulder is covered with dust. [He brushes her shoulder] A naive man is nothing better than a fool, but you women contrive to be naive in such a way that in you it seems sweet, and gentle, and proper, and not as silly as it really is. What a strange way you have, though, of ignoring a man as long as he is well and happy, and fastening yourselves to him as soon as he begins to whine and go down-hill! Do you actually think it is worse to be the wife of a strong man than to nurse some whimpering invalid?
[Embarrassed]  How do you do?
[Sings] 
[Shuddering]  Are you making fun of me?
[Angrily]  So that is the sort of man you are? Now I understand you, and can see how degraded, how dishonourable you are! Do you remember that you came to me once and lied to me about your love? I believed you, and left my mother, my father, and my faith to follow you. Yes, you lied to me of goodness and honour, of your noble aspirations and I believed every word----
[Laughing]  The woman's head has been turned. Before she fixed her eye on a title she was like any other woman, but there is no coming near her now! [Angrily] A boor, indeed!
[Excitedly]  Listen to me; tell me honestly, what do you think of Ivanoff?
[Frightened]  Oh! How can you say that?
[Embarrassed]  My dear boy, I haven't a penny. All right though. That is to say, I can't promise anything, but you understand--very well, very well. [Aside] This is agony!
[Impatiently]  Leave me alone! I can't abide you!
[Frightened]  How? What?
[Imploringly]  Mother!
[Sternly]  What do you want?
[Coldly]  Many thanks!
[Laughing]  This is not a wedding, but a parliament! Bravo! Bravo!
[Shrieking]  I know what he wants to do! Nicholas, for God's sake!
[Shrieking]  Nicholas! For God's sake hold him!
[Thunder]  Holy, holy, holy...
[Pause.] 
[Smokes]  Well-standing?
[Laughs]  A gentleman’s cap! You’ve got to take it off in front of the mam’selles. How do you do, good-bye! How are you?
[Coughs]  I hate you!
[Laughs]  Your houour’s a happy man. Lie down and go to sleep! What’s the use of standing like a scarecrow in the middle of the inn! This isn’t an orchard!
[Angrily]  Shut up! Nobody spoke to you, you donkey.
[Pause]  Scum!
[Groans]  I’ve got shooting-pains in my leg, like bullets of fire.... Little mother, pilgrim.
[Thunder]  Rrrr.... Go on thundering, I’m not afraid! [Looks round] Any police here?
[Loudly]  Orthodox brothers, mind your pockets and your clothes, or you’ll have to regret it. The man’s a rascal! He’ll rob you!
[Blows]  They’re like that, you can’t see them.
[Laughs]  You needn’t go to the churchyard to see ghosts, when they get up from under the floor to give advice to their relations.... A sin!... Don’t you teach people your silly notions! You’re an ignorant lot of people living in darkness.... [Lights his pipe] My father was peasant and used to be fond of teaching people. One night he stole a sack of apples from the village priest, and he brings them along and tells us, “Look, children, mind you don’t eat any apples before Easter, it’s a sin.” You’re like that.... You don’t know what a devil is, but you go calling people devils.... Take this crooked old woman, for instance. [Points to EFIMOVNA] She sees an enemy in me, but is her time, for some woman’s nonsense or other, she’s given her soul to the devil five times.
[Laughs]  Awful, isn’t it.
[Pause]  Do you hear me, or don’t you? Am I talking to you or the wall? [Stands up]
[Pause.] 
[Drinks.] 
[Drinks.] 
[Drinks]  I don’t like people getting drunk! Why the time the wedding took place, when the gentlefolk sat down to supper afterwards, she went off in a carriage... [Whispers] To the town, to her lover, a lawyer.... Eh? What do you think of her now? Just at the very moment! She would be let off lightly if she were killed for it!
[Thoughtfully]  Well... what happened then?
[Pause]  It’s gone now... too late, too late....
[Suddenly]  What else?
[Sighs]  The fool is suffering for his folly. His wife’s got children now by the lawyer and the brother-in-law has bought an estate near Poltava, and our man goes round inns like a fool, and complains to the likes of us: “I’ve lost all faith, brothers! I can’t believe in anybody now!” It’s cowardly! Every man has his grief, a snake that sucks at his heart, and does that mean that he must drink? Take our village elder, for example. His wife plays about with the schoolmaster in broad daylight, and spends his money on drink, but the elder walks about smiling to himself. He’s just a little thinner...
[Sighs]  When God gives a man strength....
[Pays]  Take your pound of flesh! Good-bye, children! Good-night and pleasant dreams! It’s time I hurried off. I’m bringing my lady a midwife from the hospital.... She must be getting wet with waiting, poor thing.... [Runs out. A pause.]
[Drinks]  How dare he? The fool! [to MERIK] Do you understand? You’re a fool, a donkey!
[Laughs]  What a woman.... Why do you keep on going round? I can’t catch you!
[Laughs]  What a business! Educated people go and invent all sorts of machines and medicines, but there hasn’t yet been a man wise enough to invent a medicine against the female sex.... They try to cure every sort of disease, and it never occurs to them that more people die of women than of disease.... Sly, stingy, cruel, brainless.... The mother-in-law torments the bride and the bride makes things square by swindling the husband... and there’s no end to it....
[Pause]  Here’s the gentleman playing the fool, but I had more sense, didn’t I, when I left my father and mother, and became a tramp?
[Pause]  Do you think I killed her?... I wouldn’t do it.... If you kill, you are sorry for it.... She can live and be happy! If only I’d never set eyes on you, or if I could only forget you, you viper’s brood! [A knocking at the door.]
[Knocking]  Who knocks? [Gets up and goes to the door] Who knocks? Go away, we’ve locked up!
[Pause]  She says, all right.
[Yells]  My wife! [Falls at her feet and sobs. A group collects around the husband and wife.]
[Aside]  He’s come to borrow money! Shan’t give him any! [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?
[Joyfully]  By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn’t hear it all!
[Interrupting]  My dear fellow... I’m so glad, and so on.... Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV] I’ve been hoping for it for a long time. It’s been my continual desire. [Sheds a tear] And I’ve always loved you, my angel, as if you were my own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I did so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I’m off my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul... I’ll go and call Natasha, and all that.
[Exit.] 
[Drinks]  And it’s impossible for me not to marry.... In the first place, I’m already 35--a critical age, so to speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life.... I suffer from palpitations, I’m excitable and always getting awfully upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there’s a twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly something in my left side--gives a pull, and I can feel it in my shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there’s another pull! And this may happen twenty times....
[Excited]  You see, honoured Natalya Stepanovna... the fact is, I’ve made up my mind to ask you to hear me out.... Of course you’ll be surprised and perhaps even angry, but a... [Aside] It’s awfully cold!
[Pause]  Well?
[Yells]  Oxen Meadows are mine!
[Hysterics.] 
[Wails]  Fetch him!
[Yells]  He’s coming, I tell you. Oh, what a burden, Lord, to be the father of a grown-up daughter! I’ll cut my throat! I will, indeed! We cursed him, abused him, drove him out, and it’s all you... you!
[Aside]  I wish I knew how to get him started.... [Aloud] Are you going to start shooting soon?
[Sighs]  My very best dog, to say nothing of the expense. I gave Mironov 125 roubles for him.
[Laughs]  Squeezer better than Guess!
[Shouts]  Shut up!
[Weeps]  Shut up! My heart’s bursting!
[Teasing]  My heart.... What sort of a hunter are you? You ought to go and lie on the kitchen oven and catch blackbeetles, not go after foxes! My heart!
[Shouts]  Shut up!
[Wails]  He’s dead... dead!
[Wails]  He’s alive... Yes, yes, I’m willing....
[Sighs]  I suppose he couldn’t find one anywhere, or he’d have brought him.... You think we don’t mind? We’d begrudge our child nothing. A general, of course...
[Shouting]  Promenade! Messieurs, promenade! [Behind] Promenade!
[Sings]  “I loved you; love was vain then....” Exquisite!
[Sings]  “I loved you, and may love again.” Is that it?
[Shouts]  Supper! Young people!
[Aside]  Wonderful woman! I’m in love! Up to my ears!
[Rising]  Ladies and gentlemen! I must tell you this.... We are going to have a great many toasts and speeches. Don’t let’s wait, but begin at once. Ladies and gentlemen, the newly married!
[Meditatively]  Electricity... h’m.... In my opinion electric lighting is just a swindle.... They put a live coal in and think you don’t see them! No, if you want a light, then you don’t take a coal, but something real, something special, that you can get hold of! You must have a fire, you understand, which is natural, not just an invention!
[Tearfully]  I brought her up, I fed her, I nursed her.... I cared for her more than if she was an emerald jewel, my little girl....
[Shouts]  The health of the bride’s parents, Evdokim Zaharitch and Nastasya Timofeyevna! [Band plays a flourish. Cheers.]
[Sighs]  One doesn’t like to spend money for nothing, Andrey darling!
[Shouts]  Musicians! A march! [The band plays a march for a minute.]
[Bowing]  Please come in, your excellency! So glad you’ve come!
[Whispers]  I know, only, Fyodor Yakovlevitch, be a good man and let us call you your excellency! The family here, you see, is patriarchal; it respects the aged, it likes rank.
[Taps.] 
[Rising]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[Interrupting]  Yes, you’ve got to remember all that! For instance, “Hoist the topsail halyards. Lower the topsail gallants!”
[Annoyed]  Why does he keep on interrupting? We shan’t get through a single speech like that!
[Exploding]  General, your manners.... You ought to be ashamed of yourself, at your age!
[Loudly]  I say you ought to be ashamed of yourself at your age! General, your manners are awful!
[Confused]  Ladies and gentlemen, is it worth it? Really...
[Upset]  What money?
[Shouts]  The health of the bride and bridegroom! A march! A march! [The band plays a march] The health of the bride and bridegroom!
[Sighs]  You’ve forgotten all your neighbours. You don’t go anywhere, and you see nobody. We live, so to speak, like spiders, and never see the light. The mice have eaten my livery. It isn’t as if there were no good people around, for the district’s full of them. There’s a regiment quartered at Riblov, and the officers are such beauties--you can never gaze your fill at them. And, every Friday, there’s a ball at the camp, and every day the soldier’s band plays.... Eh, my lady! You’re young and beautiful, with roses in your cheek--if you only took a little pleasure. Beauty won’t last long, you know. In ten years’ time you’ll want to be a pea-hen yourself among the officers, but they won’t look at you, it will be too late.
[Weeps.] 
[Shaking]  Who’s that? Tell them that I receive nobody.
[Exit.] 
[Annoyed]  Very well, ask him in.... What manners! [Exit LUKA] How these people annoy me! What does he want of me? Why should he disturb my peace? [Sighs] No, I see that I shall have to go into a convent after all. [Thoughtfully] Yes, into a convent.... [Enter LUKA with SMIRNOV.]
[Yells]  Waiter!
[Angrily]  What?
[Aside]  The devil’s come to stay.... Bad luck that brought him.... [Exit.]
[Yells]  Waiter!
[Exploding]  What? How dare you say all that to me?
[Sits]  I don’t like it.
[Aside]  Oh, how angry I am! How angry I am!
[Pause]  Aren’t you going? No?
[Shouts]  Dasha! Pelageya! Dasha! [Rings.]
[Kneels]  Have pity on a poor old man, and go away from here! You’ve frightened her to death, and now you want to shoot her!
[Weeps]  Dear... dear sir, do go away!
[Exit.] 
[Laughs]  He likes me! He dares to say that he likes me! [Points to the door] That’s the way.
[Yells]  Waiter, water!
[Yells]  Let’s go out and fight!
[Stops]  Well?
[Yells]  Where are you going? Stop.... No, go away. Oh, how angry I am! Don’t come near me, don’t come near me!
[Delighted]  Really? Then you’ll know Olga Pavlovna Finberg, who lives there?
[Stamping]  Give me the sewing-machine! Where’s the bird-cage? Now get on top yourself! Eat me! Tear me to pieces! Kill me! [Clenching his fists] I want blood! Blood! Blood!
[Rudely]  As it’s an anniversary, Andrey Andreyevitch, I’ll ask for a special favour. Please, even if it’s only out of respect for my toil, don’t interfere in my family life. Please!
[Sighs]  Yours is an impossible character, Kusma Nicolaievitch! You’re an excellent and respected man, but you behave to women like some scoundrel. Yes, really. I don’t understand why you hate them so?
[Pause.] 
[Excitedly]  But you will admit that it’s untidy! You spoil the _ensemble_!
[Panting]  Were you very dull without me? Are you well? I haven’t been home yet, I came here straight from the station. I’ve a lot, a lot to tell you.... I couldn’t wait.... I shan’t take off my clothes, I’ll only stay a minute. [To KHIRIN] Good morning, Kusma Nicolaievitch! [To her husband] Is everything all right at home?
[Confused]  My dear, we don’t talk about these things. You’d really better go home.
[Laughs]  I told them that I wasn’t married... and they did look after me! We chattered till midnight, the brunette kept on telling the most awfully funny stories, and the sailor kept on singing. My chest began to ache from laughing. And when the sailor--oh, those sailors!--when he got to know my name was TATIANA, you know what he sang? [Sings in a bass voice] “Onegin don’t let me conceal it, I love Tatiana madly!” [Note: From the Opera _Evgeni Onegin_--words by Pushkin.] [Roars with laughter.]
[Angrily]  Excuse me, you’ve made me lose my place! You go talking about your mamma and Katya, and I understand nothing; and I’ve lost my place.
[Laughs.] 
[Irritated]  That’s all right; I quite believe you, but it’s not our business. [Behind the scene, TATIANA ALEXEYEVNA’S laughter is heard, then a man’s. SHIPUCHIN glances at the door] She’s disturbing the employees. [To MERCHUTKINA] It’s strange and it’s even silly. Surely your husband knows where you ought to apply?
[Sighs]  Ouf!
[Surprised]  And where’s the money?
[Offended]  What? Well, never mind, never mind.... You can do that to your own wife, but I’m the wife of a civil servant.... You can’t do that to me!
[Stamping.] 
[Dully]  What else? What do you want?
[Aside]  My gout’s coming on!
[Frightened]  No, no! She’ll kick up a row and we aren’t the only people in the building.
[Panting]  Ouf!
[Exhausted]  How much do you want?
[Sighs]  Ouf!
[Weeps]  We ran to the summer-house, and there... there poor Grendilevsky was lying... with a pistol in his hand....
[Weeping]  He’d shot himself right in the heart... here.... And the poor man had fallen down senseless.... And he was awfully frightened, as he lay there... and asked for a doctor. A doctor came soon... and saved the unhappy man....
[Weeps]  I can’t stand it! [Stretches out both his hands in despair to KHIRIN] Drive her away! Drive her away, I implore you!
[Points]  That one!
[Shouts]  Stop! I ask you! I implore you!
[Screams]  Little fathers!...
[Shouts]  Help! Help!... Oh, oh... I’m sick, I’m sick! [Jumps on to a chair, then falls on to the sofa and groans as if in a faint.]
[Stamps]  Get out of it, devil take me! [Turns up his sleeves] Give her to me: I may break the law!
[Groans]  Oh! Oh!
[Groans]  Water! Water!
[Continues]  The reputation [Coughs]... the reputation of the bank has been raised by you to such a height that we are now the rivals of the best foreign concerns.
[Pause]  I’m always having headaches from having to go to the High School every day and then teach till evening. Strange thoughts come to me, as if I were already an old woman. And really, during these four years that I have been working here, I have been feeling as if every day my strength and youth have been squeezed out of me, drop by drop. And only one desire grows and gains in strength...
[Pause]  I should love my husband.
[Tenderly]  I’ll refuse, I’ll refuse....
[Laughs.] 
[Laughs]  It’s quite true, I never have worked. After I came down from the university I never stirred a finger or opened a book, I just read the papers.... [Takes another newspaper out of his pocket] Here we are.... I’ve learnt from the papers that there used to be one, Dobrolubov [Note: Dobroluboy (1836-81), in spite of the shortness of his career, established himself as one of the classic literary critics of Russia], for instance, but what he wrote--I don’t know... God only knows.... [Somebody is heard tapping on the floor from below] There.... They’re calling me downstairs, somebody’s come to see me. I’ll be back in a minute... won’t be long.... [Exit hurriedly, scratching his beard.]
[Displeased]  You are queer....
[Crying]  I understand you, Masha.
[Pause.] 
[Louder]  Please thank him.
[Exeunt.] 
[Laughs]  I told you so!
[Gaily]  I am glad, very glad! But there are three sisters, surely. I remember--three little girls. I forget your faces, but your father, Colonel Prosorov, used to have three little girls, I remember that perfectly, I saw them with my own eyes. How time does fly! Oh, dear, how it flies!
[Briskly]  I remember: Do you remember, Olga, they used to speak at home of a “lovelorn Major.” You were only a Lieutenant then, and in love with somebody, but for some reason they always called you a Major for fun.
[Laughs]  That’s it... the lovelorn Major, that’s got it!
[Crying]  And I’m crying too.
[Pause]  Here the river is so wide and fine! It’s a splendid river!
[Pause]  And the curious thing is that we can’t possibly find out what will come to be regarded as great and important, and what will be feeble, or silly. Didn’t the discoveries of Copernicus, or Columbus, say, seem unnecessary and ludicrous at first, while wasn’t it thought that some rubbish written by a fool, held all the truth? And it may so happen that our present existence, with which we are so satisfied, will in time appear strange, inconvenient, stupid, unclean, perhaps even sinful....
[Feebly]  There, there, there.
[Applauds]  Bravo, Bravo! Encore! Little Andrey is in love.
[Laughs]  You know a lot too much! I don’t think there can really be a town so dull and stupid as to have no place for a clever, cultured person. Let us suppose even that among the hundred thousand inhabitants of this backward and uneducated town, there are only three persons like yourself. It stands to reason that you won’t be able to conquer that dark mob around you; little by little as you grow older you will be bound to give way and lose yourselves in this crowd of a hundred thousand human beings; their life will suck you up in itself, but still, you won’t disappear having influenced nobody; later on, others like you will come, perhaps six of them, then twelve, and so on, until at last your sort will be in the majority. In two or three hundred years’ time life on this earth will be unimaginably beautiful and wonderful. Mankind needs such a life, and if it is not ours to-day then we must look ahead for it, wait, think, prepare for it. We must see and know more than our fathers and grandfathers saw and knew. [Laughs] And you complain that you know too much.
[Sighs]  Yes, all that ought to be written down.
[Pause.] 
[Laughs]  I couldn’t have, surely! You’d better give it back to me in that case, or else give it to the Colonel. Take it, Colonel. You’ll read it some day when you’re bored.
[Bows]  I seem to have dropped in on your name-day. Forgive me, I didn’t know, and I didn’t offer you my congratulations. [Goes with OLGA into the dining-room.]
[Hurt]  My dear Masha, why not?
[Angrily]  All right, I’ll go, only please stand back.... [Steps away.]
[Gaily]  Your health, Colonel! I’m a pedagogue and not quite at home here. I’m Masha’s husband.... She’s a good sort, a very good sort.
[Drinks]  Your health! [To OLGA] I’m very comfortable here!
[Impatiently]  Andrey, when are you coming?
[Off]  One minute. [Enters and goes to the table.]
[Pause]  You’re twenty. I’m not yet thirty. How many years are there left to us, with their long, long lines of days, filled with my love for you....
[Tearfully]  Phoo! How disgusting!
[Laughs.] 
[Angrily]  Please don’t! Aren’t you tired of it?
[Loudly]  Congratulations and best wishes! Lovely weather to-day, simply perfect. Was out walking with the High School students all the morning. I take their drills.
[Tearfully]  What am I saying that for? I’ve had those words running in my head all day....
[Aloud]  Surely you don’t believe in that superstition? [Laughter.]
[Laughter.] 
[Sighs]  I said to your sister this morning, “Irina, darling, you must take care of yourself.” But she pays no attention. Did you say it was a quarter past eight? I am afraid little Bobby is quite ill. Why is he so cold? He was feverish yesterday, but to-day he is quite cold... I am so frightened!
[Hesitatingly]  But what about my sisters. This is their flat.
[Going]  I ordered sour milk for supper. The doctor says you must eat sour milk and nothing else, or you won’t get thin. [Stops] Bobby is so cold. I’m afraid his room is too cold for him. It would be nice to put him into another room till the warm weather comes. Irina’s room, for instance, is just right for a child: it’s dry and has the sun all day. I must tell her, she can share Olga’s room. It isn’t as if she was at home in the daytime, she only sleeps here.... [A pause] Andrey, darling, why are you so silent?
[Yawns]  Call him here.
[Pause]  I don’t know. Of course, habit counts for a great deal. After father’s death, for instance, it took us a long time to get used to the absence of orderlies. But, apart from habit, it seems to me in all fairness that, however it may be in other towns, the best and most-educated people are army men.
[Pause]  I never speak of her, it’s strange that I bear my complaints to you alone. [Kisses her hand] Don’t be angry with me. I haven’t anybody but you, nobody at all.... [Pause.]
[Laughing]  When you talk to me like that, I laugh; I don’t know why, for I’m afraid. Don’t repeat it, please.... [In an undertone] No, go on, it’s all the same to me.... [Covers her face with her hands] Somebody’s coming, let’s talk about something else.
[Smiling]  When you come home from your work you seem so young, and so unfortunate.... [Pause.]
[Laughs]  We go there in June, and before June there’s still... February, March, April, May... nearly half a year!
[Laughs]  No. He’s been here eight months and hasn’t paid a copeck. Seems to have forgotten.
[Laughs]  What dignity in his pose! [They all laugh. A pause.]
[Thoughtfully]  How can I put it? It seems to me that everything on earth must change, little by little, and is already changing under our very eyes. After two or three hundred years, after a thousand--the actual time doesn’t matter--a new and happy age will begin. We, of course, shall not take part in it, but we live and work and even suffer to-day that it should come. We create it--and in that one object is our destiny and, if you like, our happiness.
[Pause]  If not for me, then for the descendants of my descendants.
[Pause.] 
[Reading]  Balzac was married at Berdichev. [IRINA is singing softly] That’s worth making a note of. [He makes a note] Balzac was married at Berdichev. [Goes on reading.]
[Loudly]  Doctor, how old are you?
[Laughter] 
[Laughs]  That means you won’t go to Moscow.
[Quietly]  My wife has poisoned herself again. I must go. I’ll go out quietly. It’s all awfully unpleasant. [Kisses MASHA’S hand] My dear, my splendid, good woman... I’ll go this way, quietly. [Exit.]
[Angrily]  Be quiet! You bother so one can’t have a moment’s peace.... [Goes to the table with her cup] I’m tired of you, old woman!
[Mocking]  Anfisa! He sits there and... [Exit.]
[Sighs]  Dear Masha, why use such expressions? With your beautiful exterior you would be simply fascinating in good society, I tell you so directly, if it wasn’t for your words. _Je vous prie, pardonnez moi, Marie, mais vous avez des manières un peu grossières_.
[Exit.] 
[Declaims]  “I am strange, but who is not? Don’t be angry, Aleko!”
[Pause.] 
[Declaims]  “Do not be angry, Aleko... forget, forget, thy dreams of yore....”
[Imploring]  Please, please! I ask you!
[Dances] 
[Laughter.] 
[Laughs]  Come on, now. I’m going to play. Funny man, Soleni.... [Goes to the piano and plays a waltz.]
[Loudly]  I slept late after dinner to-day because I thought I was going to dance all night. It’s only nine o’clock now!
[Enters]  What’s that?
[Whispers]  The entertainers! [Bell.]
[Coldly]  Stop it, Vassili Vassilevitch!
[Exit.] 
[Sits]  Andrey lost 200 roubles at cards yesterday... the whole town is talking about it....
[Sits.] 
[Going]  I’m free to-morrow.... Oh, my God, what a mercy! I’m free to-morrow, I’m free the day after.... Oh my head, my head.... [Exit.]
[alone]  They’ve all gone. Nobody’s left.
[Rings]  They’ll never answer.... [At the door] Come here, whoever there is! [Through the open door can be seen a window, red with flame: afire-engine is heard passing the house] How awful this is. And how I’m sick of it! [FERAPONT enters] Take these things down.... The Kolotilin girls are down below... and let them have them. This, too.
[Exit.] 
[Tired]  Olga, dear girl, don’t dismiss me! Don’t dismiss me!
[Confusedly]  Excuse me, I don’t understand either...
[Excited]  Forgive me, Olga, forgive me... I didn’t want to annoy you.
[Surprised]  What do you mean? She’s only a servant. [Crying] I don’t understand you, Olga. I’ve got a nurse, a wet-nurse, we’ve a cook, a housemaid... what do we want that old woman for as well? What good is she? [Fire-alarm behind the stage.]
[Stamping]  that witch! And don’t you dare to annoy me! Don’t you dare! [Stopping short] Really, if you don’t move downstairs, we shall always be quarrelling. This is awful.
[Angrily]  Devil take them all... take them all.... They think I’m a doctor and can cure everything, and I know absolutely nothing, I’ve forgotten all I ever knew, I remember nothing, absolutely nothing. [OLGA and NATASHA go out, unnoticed by him] Devil take it. Last Wednesday I attended a woman in Zasip--and she died, and it’s my fault that she died. Yes... I used to know a certain amount five-and-twenty years ago, but I don’t remember anything now. Nothing. Perhaps I’m not really a man, and am only pretending that I’ve got arms and legs and a head; perhaps I don’t exist at all, and only imagine that I walk, and eat, and sleep. [Cries] Oh, if only I didn’t exist! [Stops crying; angrily] The devil only knows.... Day before yesterday they were talking in the club; they said, Shakespeare, Voltaire... I’d never read, never read at all, and I put on an expression as if I had read. And so did the others. Oh, how beastly! How petty! And then I remembered the woman I killed on Wednesday... and I couldn’t get her out of my mind, and everything in my mind became crooked, nasty, wretched.... So I went and drank....
[Laughs]  Speaking’s a bit difficult, eh, Ivan Romanovitch! [Pats him on the shoulder] Good man! _In vino veritas_, the ancients used to say.
[Sighs]  Yes.... But will it be quite all right for her to take part in a concert? [Pause] You see, I don’t know anything about it. Perhaps it will even be all to the good. Although I must admit that our Director is a good man, a very good man even, a very clever man, still he has such views.... Of course it isn’t his business but still, if you wish it, perhaps I’d better talk to him.
[Pause]  Yesterday I happened to hear, casually, that they want to transfer our brigade to some distant place. Some said to Poland, others, to Chita.
[Laughs]  How strange everything really is! [Pause] When the fire broke out, I hurried off home; when I get there I see the house is whole, uninjured, and in no danger, but my two girls are standing by the door in just their underclothes, their mother isn’t there, the crowd is excited, horses and dogs are running about, and the girls’ faces are so agitated, terrified, beseeching, and I don’t know what else. My heart was pained when I saw those faces. My God, I thought, what these girls will have to put up with if they live long! I caught them up and ran, and still kept on thinking the one thing: what they will have to live through in this world! [Fire-alarm; a pause] I come here and find their mother shouting and angry. [MASHA enters with a pillow and sits on the sofa] And when my girls were standing by the door in just their underclothes, and the street was red from the fire, there was a dreadful noise, and I thought that something of the sort used to happen many years ago when an enemy made a sudden attack, and looted, and burned.... And at the same time what a difference there really is between the present and the past! And when a little more time has gone by, in two or three hundred years perhaps, people will look at our present life with just the same fear, and the same contempt, and the whole past will seem clumsy and dull, and very uncomfortable, and strange. Oh, indeed, what a life there will be, what a life! [Laughs] Forgive me, I’ve dropped into philosophy again. Please let me continue. I do awfully want to philosophize, it’s just how I feel at present. [Pause] As if they are all asleep. As I was saying: what a life there will be! Only just imagine.... There are only three persons like yourselves in the town just now, but in future generations there will be more and more, and still more, and the time will come when everything will change and become as you would have it, people will live as you do, and then you too will go out of date; people will be born who are better than you.... [Laughs] Yes, to-day I am quite exceptionally in the vein. I am devilishly keen on living.... [Sings.]
[Laughs.] 
[Laughs.] 
[Dancing]  I’m burnt out, I’m burnt out! Down to the ground! [Laughter.]
[Laughs]  Absolutely. Nothing left at all. The guitar’s burnt, and the photographs are burnt, and all my correspondence.... And I was going to make you a present of a note-book, and that’s burnt too.
[Waking]  I am tired, I must say.... The brickworks.... No, I’m not wandering, I mean it; I’m going to start work soon at the brickworks... I’ve already talked it over. [Tenderly, to IRINA] You’re so pale, and beautiful, and charming.... Your paleness seems to shine through the dark air as if it was a light.... You are sad, displeased with life.... Oh, come with me, let’s go and work together!
[Laughs]  Are you here? I didn’t see you. [Kisses IRINA’S hand] good-bye, I’ll go... I look at you now and I remember, as if it was long ago, your name-day, when you, cheerfully and merrily, were talking about the joys of labour.... And how happy life seemed to me, then! What has happened to it now? [Kisses her hand] There are tears in your eyes. Go to bed now; it is already day... the morning begins.... If only I was allowed to give my life for you!
[Exit.] 
[Angrily]  Amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, amant.
[Laughs]  No, she really is wonderful. I’ve been your husband seven years, and it seems as if I was only married yesterday. On my word. No, you really are a wonderful woman. I’m satisfied, I’m satisfied, I’m satisfied!
[Pause]  You go, Feodor.
[Nervily]  Oh, it’s awful, awful, awful. [Weeps] I can’t, I can’t bear it any longer!... I can’t, I can’t!... [OLGA comes in and clears up at her little table. IRINA is sobbing loudly] Throw me out, throw me out, I can’t bear any more!
[Alarmed]  What is it, what is it? Dear!
[Sobbing]  Where? Where has everything gone? Where is it all? Oh my God, my God! I’ve forgotten everything, everything... I don’t remember what is the Italian for window or, well, for ceiling... I forget everything, every day I forget it, and life passes and will never return, and we’ll never go away to Moscow... I see that we’ll never go....
[Pause.] 
[Softly]  It’s my secret but you must know everything... I can’t be silent.... [Pause] I love, I love... I love that man.... You saw him only just now.... Why don’t I say it... in one word. I love Vershinin.
[Angrily]  What do you want? I don’t understand.
[Excited]  What an awful night!
[Pause]  In the second place, you seem to be annoyed because I am not a professor, and am not engaged in study. But I work for the zemstvo, I am a member of the district council, and I consider my service as worthy and as high as the service of science. I am a member of the district council, and I am proud of it, if you want to know. [Pause] In the third place, I have still this to say... that I have mortgaged the house without obtaining your permission.... For that I am to blame, and ask to be forgiven. My debts led me into doing it... thirty-five thousand... I do not play at cards any more, I stopped long ago, but the chief thing I have to say in my defence is that you girls receive a pension, and I don’t... my wages, so to speak.... [Pause.]
[Pause]  Olga! [Looks out] Did you hear? They are taking the brigade away from us; it’s going to be transferred to some place far away.
[Grieved]  Don’t be in such a hurry!
[Shouts]  Yo-ho!
[Shouts]  Good-bye!
[Sits.] 
[Laughs]  Awfully funny, that. They say that Soleni is in love with Irina and hates the Baron.... That’s quite natural. Irina is a very nice girl. She’s even like Masha, she’s so thoughtful.... Only, Irina your character is gentler. Though Masha’s character, too, is a very good one. I’m very fond of Masha. [Shouts of “Yo-ho!” are heard behind the stage.]
[Shudders]  Everything seems to frighten me today. [Pause] I’ve got everything ready, and I send my things off after dinner. The Baron and I will be married to-morrow, and to-morrow we go away to the brickworks, and the next day I go to the school, and the new life begins. God will help me! When I took my examination for the teacher’s post, I actually wept for joy and gratitude.... [Pause] The cart will be here in a minute for my things....
[Sighs]  To-day the soldiers will be gone, and everything will go on as in the old days. Say what you will, Masha is a good, honest woman. I love her very much, and thank my fate for her. People have such different fates. There’s a Kosirev who works in the excise department here. He was at school with me; he was expelled from the fifth class of the High School for being entirely unable to understand _ut consecutivum_. He’s awfully hard up now and in very poor health, and when I meet him I say to him, “How do you do, _ut consecutivum_.” “Yes,” he says, “precisely _consecutivum_...” and coughs. But I’ve been successful all my life, I’m happy, and I even have a Stanislaus Cross, of the second class, and now I myself teach others that _ut consecutivum_. Of course, I’m a clever man, much cleverer than many, but happiness doesn’t only lie in that....
[Pause]  Protopopov is sitting there in the drawing-room; and he came to-day...
[Sits]  Nothing.... [Pause] Did you love my mother?
[Pause]  Something happened yesterday by the theatre. The whole town knows of it, but I don’t.
[Pause.] 
[Going]  You live in a climate like this, where it might snow any moment, and there you talk.... [Stops] I won’t go into the house, I can’t go there.... Tell me when Vershinin comes.... [Goes along the avenue] The migrant birds are already on the wing.... [Looks up] Swans or geese.... My dear, happy things.... [Exit.]
[Rises]  I’m going away to-morrow, old chap, and perhaps we’ll never meet again, so here’s my advice. Put on your cap, take a stick in your hand, go... go on and on, without looking round. And the farther you go, the better.
[Angry]  Mind your own business.
[Pause]  The town will be empty.
[Pause]  What took place by the theatre yesterday?
[Cries]  I have never been in love in my life. Oh, I used to think so much of love, I have been thinking about it for so long by day and by night, but my soul is like an expensive piano which is locked and the key lost. [Pause] You seem so unhappy.
[Pause]  say something to me....
[Pause.] 
[Nervously]  No, no! [He goes quickly and stops in the avenue] Irina!
[Confused]  I’m speaking quietly.
[Shouts]  Little Masha, co-ee! [Goes out with IRINA down into the garden] Co-ee, co-ee!
[Pause]  My wife and both my daughters will stay here another two months. If anything happens, or if anything has to be done...
[Pause]  To-morrow there won’t be a single soldier left in the town, it will all be a memory, and, of course, for us a new life will begin.... [Pause] None of our plans are coming right. I didn’t want to be a head-mistress, but they made me one, all the same. It means there’s no chance of Moscow....
[Laughs]  Life is heavy. To many of us it seems dull and hopeless, but still, it must be acknowledged that it is getting lighter and clearer, and it seems that the time is not far off when it will be quite clear. [Looks at his watch] It’s time I went! Mankind used to be absorbed in wars, and all its existence was filled with campaigns, attacks, defeats, now we’ve outlived all that, leaving after us a great waste place, which there is nothing to fill with at present; but mankind is looking for something, and will certainly find it. Oh, if it only happened more quickly. [Pause] If only education could be added to industry, and industry to education. [Looks at his watch] It’s time I went....
[Confused]  Never mind, let her cry, let her.... My dear Masha, my good Masha.... You’re my wife, and I’m happy, whatever happens... I’m not complaining, I don’t reproach you at all.... Olga is a witness to it. Let’s begin to live again as we used to, and not by a single word, or hint...
[Angrily]  I shan’t go in there. [Sobs, but controls herself at once] I’m not going to go into the house, I won’t go....
[Pause.] 
[Laughs]  Yes. [MASHA weeps.]
[Sighs]  In the first place I shall have that avenue of fir-trees cut down, then that maple. It’s so ugly at nights.... [To IRINA] That belt doesn’t suit you at all, dear.... It’s an error of taste. And I’ll give orders to have lots and lots of little flowers planted here, and they’ll smell.... [Severely] Why is there a fork lying about here on the seat? [Going towards the house, to the maid] Why is there a fork lying about here on the seat, I say? [Shouts] Don’t you dare to answer me!
[Pause]  What is it?
[Frightened]  It can’t be true!
[Sadly]  Still, it’s all the same!
[Cries.] 
[Listening]  I think I hear them coming.
[Listens]  No.... They’ve got to collect their luggage and so on.... [Pause] Lubov Andreyevna has been living abroad for five years; I don’t know what she’ll be like now.... She’s a good sort--an easy, simple person. I remember when I was a boy of fifteen, my father, who is dead--he used to keep a shop in the village here--hit me on the face with his fist, and my nose bled.... We had gone into the yard together for something or other, and he was a little drunk. Lubov Andreyevna, as I remember her now, was still young, and very thin, and she took me to the washstand here in this very room, the nursery. She said, “Don’t cry, little man, it’ll be all right in time for your wedding.” [Pause] “Little man”.... My father was a peasant, it’s true, but here I am in a white waistcoat and yellow shoes... a pearl out of an oyster. I’m rich now, with lots of money, but just think about it and examine me, and you’ll find I’m still a peasant down to the marrow of my bones. [Turns over the pages of his book] Here I’ve been reading this book, but I understood nothing. I read and fell asleep. [Pause.]
[Exit.] 
[Sighs]  I can’t. Our climate is indisposed to favour us even this once. And, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, allow me to say to you, in addition, that I bought myself some boots two days ago, and I beg to assure you that they squeak in a perfectly unbearable manner. What shall I put on them?
[Listens]  There they come, I think.
[Excited]  I shall faint in a minute.... Oh, I’m fainting!
[Weeps]  And here I am like a little girl again. [Kisses her brother, VARYA, then her brother again] And Varya is just as she used to be, just like a nun. And I knew Dunyasha. [Kisses her.]
[Astonished]  To think of that, now!
[Tired]  Something else now...?
[Joyfully]  Peter!
[Exit.] 
[Weeping]  Don’t say any more, don’t say any more....
[Sadly]  Mother bought it. [Goes into her room, and talks lightly, like a child] In Paris I went up in a balloon!
[Thoughtfully]  Father died six years ago, and a month later my brother Grisha was drowned in the river--such a dear little boy of seven! Mother couldn’t bear it; she went away, away, without looking round.... [Shudders] How I understand her; if only she knew! [Pause] And Peter Trofimov was Grisha’s tutor, he might tell her....
[Joyfully]  The mistress is home again. I’ve lived to see her! Don’t care if I die now.... [Weeps with joy.]
[Laughs]  You’re just the same as ever, Varya. [Draws her close and kisses her] I’ll have some coffee now, then we’ll all go. [FIERS lays a cushion under her feet] Thank you, dear. I’m used to coffee. I drink it day and night. Thank you, dear old man. [Kisses FIERS.]
[Exit.] 
[Laughs]  I want to jump about and wave my arms. [Covers her face with her hands] But suppose I’m dreaming! God knows I love my own country, I love it deeply; I couldn’t look out of the railway carriage, I cried so much. [Through her tears] Still, I must have my coffee. Thank you, Fiers. Thank you, dear old man. I’m so glad you’re still with us.
[Angry]  What rot!
[Astonished]  A hundred years.... Think of that!
[Frightened]  You’re off your head!
[Mumbles.] 
[Exit.] 
[Angrily]  Do go, now!
[Exit.] 
[Frightened]  We haven’t got it, we haven’t got it!
[Laughs]  I never lose hope. I used to think, “Everything’s lost now. I’m a dead man,” when, lo and behold, a railway was built over my land... and they paid me for it. And something else will happen to-day or to-morrow. Dashenka may win 20,000 roubles... she’s got a lottery ticket.
[Quietly]  Anya’s asleep. [Opens window quietly] The sun has risen already; it isn’t cold. Look, little mother: what lovely trees! And the air! The starlings are singing!
[Crying]  It’s Peter Trofimov.
[Confused]  That’s enough, that’s enough, Luba.
[Weeps]  But I told you, Peter, to wait till to-morrow.
[Grins]  You are just the same as ever, Leonid Andreyevitch.
[Exit.] 
[Pause]  If there’s any illness for which people offer many remedies, you may be sure that particular illness is incurable, I think. I work my brains to their hardest. I’ve several remedies, very many, and that really means I’ve none at all. It would be nice to inherit a fortune from somebody, it would be nice to marry our Anya to a rich man, it would be nice to go to Yaroslav and try my luck with my aunt the Countess. My aunt is very, very rich.
[Weeps]  If only God helped us.
[Whispers]  Anya’s in the doorway.
[Pause]  It’s curious, something’s got into my right eye... I can’t see properly out of it. And on Thursday, when I was at the District Court...
[Reproachfully]  Leonid Andreyevitch, don’t you fear God? When are you going to bed?
[Angrily]  Leonid Andreyevitch!
[Yawns]  He comes. “What’s this,” I say, “Evstigney, you old fool.”... [Looks at ANYA] Anya dear! [Pause] She’s dropped off.... [Takes ANYA’S arm] Let’s go to bye-bye.... Come along!... [Leads her] My darling’s gone to sleep! Come on.... [They go. In the distance, the other side of the orchard, a shepherd plays his pipe. TROFIMOV crosses the stage and stops on seeing VARYA and ANYA] Sh! She’s asleep, asleep. Come on, dear.
[Moved]  My sun! My spring!
[Thoughtfully]  I haven’t a real passport. I don’t know how old I am, and I think I’m young. When I was a little girl my father and mother used to go round fairs and give very good performances and I used to do the _salto mortale_ and various little things. And when papa and mamma died a German lady took me to her and began to teach me. I liked it. I grew up and became a governess. And where I came from and who I am, I don’t know.... Who my parents were--perhaps they weren’t married--I don’t know. [Takes a cucumber out of her pocket and eats] I don’t know anything. [Pause] I do want to talk, but I haven’t anybody to talk to... I haven’t anybody at all.
[Sings] 
[Sighs.] 
[Shy]  Very well, only first bring me my little cloak.... It’s by the cupboard. It’s a little damp here.
[Yawns.] 
[Pause]  I’m so nervous, I’m worried. I went into service when I was quite a little girl, and now I’m not used to common life, and my hands are white, white as a lady’s. I’m so tender and so delicate now; respectable and afraid of everything.... I’m so frightened. And I don’t know what will happen to my nerves if you deceive me, Yasha.
[Pause.] 
[Yawns]  Yes. I think this: if a girl loves anybody, then that means she’s immoral. [Pause] It’s nice to smoke a cigar out in the open air.... [Listens] Somebody’s coming. It’s the mistress, and people with her. [DUNYASHA embraces him suddenly] Go to the house, as if you’d been bathing in the river; go by this path, or they’ll meet you and will think I’ve been meeting you. I can’t stand that sort of thing.
[Sits.] 
[Sits]  Went to town and had lunch... red in the middle! I’d like to go in now and have just one game.
[Imploringly]  Give me an answer!
[Yawns]  Really!
[Laughs]  I can’t listen to your voice without laughing.
[Frightened]  No, don’t go away, do stop; be a dear. Please. Perhaps we’ll find some way out!
[Pause]  I keep on waiting for something to happen, as if the house is going to collapse over our heads.
[Listens]  I can’t hear.... [Sings quietly] “For money will the Germans make a Frenchman of a Russian.” [Laughs] I saw such an awfully funny thing at the theatre last night.
[Pause]  My father was a peasant, an idiot, he understood nothing, he didn’t teach me, he was always drunk, and always used a stick on me. In point of fact, I’m a fool and an idiot too. I’ve never learned anything, my handwriting is bad, I write so that I’m quite ashamed before people, like a pig!
[Pause.] 
[Laughs]  And when the Emancipation came I was already first valet. Only I didn’t agree with the Emancipation and remained with my people.... [Pause] I remember everybody was happy, but they didn’t know why.
[Tenderly]  Come, come, my dears.... [Embracing ANYA and VARYA] If you two only knew how much I love you. Sit down next to me, like that. [All sit down.]
[Laughs]  I wonder what you think of me?
[Ironically]  Oh, awfully!
[Thoughtfully]  Epikhodov’s there.
[Entreatingly]  Uncle, dear!
[Shudders]  It’s unpleasant, somehow. [A pause.]
[Hiccups]  Lovely weather.... [Declaims] My brother, my suffering brother.... Come out on the Volga, you whose groans... [To VARYA] Mademoiselle, please give a hungry Russian thirty copecks....
[Angrily]  There’s manners everybody’s got to keep!
[Frightened]  I’m going, I’m going.... Oh, little mother, at home there’s nothing for the servants to eat, and you gave him gold.
[Crying]  You shouldn’t joke about this, mother.
[Laughs]  Thanks to the tramp who frightened Barbara, we’re alone now.
[Pause]  Think, Anya, your grandfather, your great-grandfather, and all your ancestors were serf-owners, they owned living souls; and now, doesn’t something human look at you from every cherry in the orchard, every leaf and every stalk? Don’t you hear voices...? Oh, it’s awful, your orchard is terrible; and when in the evening or at night you walk through the orchard, then the old bark on the trees sheds a dim light and the old cherry-trees seem to be dreaming of all that was a hundred, two hundred years ago, and are oppressed by their heavy visions. Still, at any rate, we’ve left those two hundred years behind us. So far we’ve gained nothing at all--we don’t yet know what the past is to be to us--we only philosophize, we complain that we are dull, or we drink vodka. For it’s so clear that in order to begin to live in the present we must first redeem the past, and that can only be done by suffering, by strenuous, uninterrupted labour. Understand that, Anya.
[Enthusiastically]  How nicely you said that!
[Thoughtful]  The moon is rising.
[Pause]  There is happiness, there it comes; it comes nearer and nearer; I hear its steps already. And if we do not see it we shall not know it, but what does that matter? Others will see it!
[Angry]  Disgraceful!
[Sits]  But the trouble is, I’ve no money! A hungry dog only believes in meat. [Snores and wakes up again immediately] So I... only believe in money....
[Teasing]  Madame Lopakhin! Madame Lopakhin!
[Angry]  Decayed gentleman!
[Bitterly]  We’ve hired the musicians, but how are they to be paid? [Exit.]
[Applauds]  Madame ventriloquist, bravo!
[Surprised]  Think of that, now! Delightful, Charlotte Ivanovna... I’m simply in love....
[Astonished]  Think of that now!
[Applauds]  Bravo, bravo!
[Astonished]  Think of that, now.
[Sarcastically]  Oh, yes!
[Angry]  Eternal student! He’s already been expelled twice from the university.
[Exit.] 
[Weeping]  For God’s sake forgive my speaking candidly, but that man has robbed you!
[Angry]  Yes, yes! You aren’t pure, you’re just a freak, a queer fellow, a funny growth...
[Yawns]  If you’d only hurry up and kick the bucket.
[Mutters.] 
[Sits]  I’m tired.
[Excited]  Somebody in the kitchen was saying just now that the cherry orchard was sold to-day.
[Laughs.] 
[Yawns]  Impolite.... [Exit.]
[Sighs]  Oh, life!
[Sighs]  But, certainly, if you regard the matter from the aspect, then you, if I may say so, and you must excuse my candidness, have absolutely reduced me to a state of mind. I know my fate, every day something unfortunate happens to me, and I’ve grown used to it a long time ago, I even look at my fate with a smile. You gave me your word, and though I...
[Offended]  Whether I work, or walk about, or eat, or play billiards, is only a matter to be settled by people of understanding and my elders.
[Furious]  You dare? You mean that I know nothing? Get out of here! This minute!
[Nervous]  I must ask you to express yourself more delicately.
[Excited]  Well, what? Is it sold? Tell me?
[Laughs]  When we got to the sale, Deriganov was there already. Leonid Andreyevitch had only fifteen thousand roubles, and Deriganov offered thirty thousand on top of the mortgage to begin with. I saw how matters were, so I grabbed hold of him and bid forty. He went up to forty-five, I offered fifty-five. That means he went up by fives and I went up by tens.... Well, it came to an end. I bid ninety more than the mortgage; and it stayed with me. The cherry orchard is mine now, mine! [Roars with laughter] My God, my God, the cherry orchard’s mine! Tell me I’m drunk, or mad, or dreaming.... [Stamps his feet] Don’t laugh at me! If my father and grandfather rose from their graves and looked at the whole affair, and saw how their Ermolai, their beaten and uneducated Ermolai, who used to run barefoot in the winter, how that very Ermolai has bought an estate, which is the most beautiful thing in the world! I’ve bought the estate where my grandfather and my father were slaves, where they weren’t even allowed into the kitchen. I’m asleep, it’s only a dream, an illusion.... It’s the fruit of imagination, wrapped in the fog of the unknown.... [Picks up the keys, nicely smiling] She threw down the keys, she wanted to show she was no longer mistress here.... [Jingles keys] Well, it’s all one! [Hears the band tuning up] Eh, musicians, play, I want to hear you! Come and look at Ermolai Lopakhin laying his axe to the cherry orchard, come and look at the trees falling! We’ll build villas here, and our grandsons and great-grandsons will see a new life here.... Play on, music! [The band plays. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA sinks into a chair and weeps bitterly. LOPAKHIN continues reproachfully] Why then, why didn’t you take my advice? My poor, dear woman, you can’t go back now. [Weeps] Oh, if only the whole thing was done with, if only our uneven, unhappy life were changed!
[Ironically]  The new owner, the owner of the cherry orchard is coming! [He accidentally knocks up against a little table and nearly upsets the candelabra] I can pay for everything! [Exit with PISCHIN]
[Drinks]  I can assure you that this isn’t real champagne.
[Pause]  It’s devilish cold here.
[Laughs] 
[Nervously]  But I can’t find my goloshes!
[Pause]  I’ll get there and show others the way. [Axes cutting the trees are heard in the distance.]
[Exit.] 
[Exit.] 
[Offended]  I told Egor this morning. What’s the use of asking ten times!
[Grinning]  Two-and-twenty troubles.
[Exit.] 
[Gaily]  Yes, really, everything’s all right now. Before the cherry orchard was sold we all were excited and we suffered, and then, when the question was solved once and for all, we all calmed down, and even became cheerful. I’m a bank official now, and a financier... red in the middle; and you, Luba, for some reason or other, look better, there’s no doubt about it.
[Hums]  Never mind.
[Puffing]  Oh, let me get my breath back.... I’m fagged out... My most honoured, give me some water....
[Exit.] 
[Drinks]  Good-bye. I’ll come in on Thursday.
[Agitated]  What? Why to town? I see furniture... trunks.... Well, never mind. [Crying] Never mind. These Englishmen are men of immense intellect.... Never mind.... Be happy.... God will help you.... Never mind.... Everything in this world comes to an end.... [Kisses LUBOV ANDREYEVNA’S hand] And if you should happen to hear that my end has come, just remember this old... horse and say: “There was one such and such a Simeonov-Pischin, God bless his soul....” Wonderful weather... yes.... [Exit deeply moved, but returns at once and says in the door] Dashenka sent her love! [Exit.]
[Pause]  You know very well, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that I used to hope to marry her to you, and I suppose you are going to marry somebody? [Whispers to ANYA, who nods to CHARLOTTA, and they both go out] She loves you, she’s your sort, and I don’t understand, I really don’t, why you seem to be keeping away from each other. I don’t understand!
[Animated]  Excellent. We’ll go out. Yasha, allez. I’ll call her in.... [At the door] Varya, leave that and come here. Come! [Exit with YASHA.]
[Pause.] 
[Pause]  So life in this house is finished now....
[Pause]  And our thermometer’s broken.... [Pause.]
[Pause]  We must go.
[Joyfully]  Away!
[Imploringly]  Uncle!
[Stupidly]  Double the red into the middle.... I’ll be quiet.
[Hoarsely]  You may depend upon me, Ermolai Alexeyevitch!
[Suspiciously]  What manners....
[Exit.] 
[Gaily]  Mother!
[Laughing]  And yet I accidentally dropped off to sleep again after dinner, and feel utterly done up at this moment. It is like a nightmare.
[Laughing]  I have always been glad to get away from this place, but I have been retired now, and this was the only place I had to come to. Willy-nilly, one must live somewhere.
[Laughing]  Does she, really?
[Listening]  I hear footsteps! [He embraces his uncle] I cannot live without her; even the sound of her footsteps is music to me. I am madly happy. [He goes quickly to meet NINA, who comes in at that moment] My enchantress! My girl of dreams!
[Excitedly]  It can’t be that I am late? No, I am not late.
[Laughing]  I am _so_ glad to see you! [She shakes hands with SORIN.]
[Coldly]  I have never read any of them, so I can’t say.
[Sings] 
[Sings] 
[Sighing]  Pashka Tchadin! There are none left like him. The stage is not what it was in his time. There were sturdy oaks growing on it then, where now but stumps remain.
[Whispers]  What decadent rubbish is this?
[Imploringly]  Mother!
[Embarrassed]  I have read all your books.
[Loudly]  Jacob, my man! Raise the curtain!
[Startled]  No, no!
[Imploringly]  Don’t go!
[Impetuously]  Where is Nina?
[Sighing]  Ah, youth, youth!
[Tenderly]  But what can I do for you, my child? What? What?
[Crossly]  Ho! Take some camomile tea.
[Sings] 
[Imploringly]  Eugene, my darling, my beloved, take me to you. Our time is short; we are no longer young; let us end deception and concealment, even though it is only at the end of our lives. [A pause.]
[Alone]  How strange to see a famous actress weeping, and for such a trifle! Is it not strange, too, that a famous author should sit fishing all day? He is the idol of the public, the papers are full of him, his photograph is for sale everywhere, his works have been translated into many foreign languages, and yet he is overjoyed if he catches a couple of minnows. I always thought famous people were distant and proud; I thought they despised the common crowd which exalts riches and birth, and avenged themselves on it by dazzling it with the inextinguishable honour and glory of their fame. But here I see them weeping and playing cards and flying into passions like everybody else.
[Thoughtfully]  Either you exaggerate my fame, or else, if it exists, all I can say is that one simply doesn’t feel fame in any way.
[Thoughtfully]  He might possibly enter the army.
[Decidedly]  I have no money at present.
[Whistles]  Very well. Forgive me, darling; don’t be angry. You are a noble, generous woman!
[Weeping]  I really haven’t the money.
[Laughing]  Yes, exactly, and on one’s back at night. Thank you, I can walk alone.
[Tenderly]  Make your peace with him, too. Don’t fight with him. You surely won’t fight?
[Impatiently]  Yes, yes. [In deep thought] Why do I hear a note of sadness that wrings my heart in this cry of a pure soul? If at any time you should have need of my life, come and take it. [To ARKADINA] Let us stay here one more day!
[Shuddering]  No, no! I am only an ordinary woman; you must not say such things to me. Do not torment me, Boris; you frighten me.
[Imploringly]  Do come, Masha. The baby must be hungry.
[Crossly]  Be off, in God’s name!
[Apologetically]  How can I go home when they won’t give me a horse?
[Sings]  “The moon swims in the sky to-night.”
[Laughing]  I didn’t try for that, it came of its own accord.
[Laughing]  Twenty-eight years!
[Angrily]  A horse to go home with! [Sternly] You know the horses have just been to the station. I can’t send them out again.
[Thoughtfully]  I don’t remember.
[Gaily]  Bravo! Bravo!
[Despairingly]  Why, why does he talk to me like this?
[Weeping]  Let me have some water.
[Sadly]  You have found your way, you know where you are going, but I am still groping in a chaos of phantoms and dreams, not knowing whom and what end I am serving by it all. I do not believe in anything, and I do not know what my calling is.
[Listening]  Hush! I must go. Good-bye. When I have become a famous actress you must come and see me. Will you promise to come? But now--[She takes his hand] it is late. I can hardly stand. I am fainting. I am hungry.
[Frightened]  What was that?
[Ecstatically]  Oh, mother, mother, mother! (Raina pulls her mother down on the ottoman; and they kiss one another frantically.)
[Remorsefully.]  Only think, mother, I doubted him: I wondered whether all his heroic qualities and his soldiership might not prove mere imagination when he went into a real battle. I had an uneasy fear that he might cut a poor figure there beside all those clever Russian officers.
[Indignantly.]  I never saw anything so unprofessional.
[Shouting.]  Hollo, Nicola!
[Chuckling.]  We shouldn't have been able to begin fighting if these foreigners hadn't shewn us how to do it: we knew nothing about it; and neither did the Servians. Egad, there'd have been no war without them.
[Gaily.]  Have you been flirting with Louka?
[Going.] 
[Going.] 
[Vehemently.]  Be quick! (Louka runs into the house. Catherine snatches her apron off and throws it behind a bush. She then takes up the salver and uses it as a mirror, with the result that the handkerchief tied round her head follows the apron. A touch to her hair and a shake to her dressing gown makes her presentable.) Oh, how--how--how can a man be such a fool! Such a moment to select! (Louka appears at the door of the house, announcing "Captain Bluntschli;" and standing aside at the top of the steps to let him pass before she goes in again. He is the man of the adventure in Raina's room. He is now clean, well brushed, smartly uniformed, and out of trouble, but still unmistakably the same man. The moment Louka's back is turned, Catherine swoops on him with hurried, urgent, coaxing appeal.) Captain Bluntschli, I am very glad to see you; but you must leave this house at once. (He raises his eyebrows.) My husband has just returned, with my future son-in-law; and they know nothing. If they did, the consequences would be terrible. You are a foreigner: you do not feel our national animosities as we do. We still hate the Servians: the only effect of the peace on my husband is to make him feel like a lion baulked of his prey. If he discovered our secret, he would never forgive me; and my daughter's life would hardly be safe. Will you, like the chivalrous gentleman and soldier you are, leave at once before he finds you here?
[appealingly]  Captain Bluntschli really wishes to stay. He knows my wishes.
[Discouraged.]  Ah, well, what does it matter? I suppose, now that you've found me out, you despise me.
[Shouting]  Nicola!

[Sarcastically.]  A nobleman, I 'spose.
[Plaintively.]  She said I'd understand; but I don't. Please don't tell her I told you.
[Fiercely.]  Speak, man: have you no feeling for me?
[Vehemently.]  Shame on you! For shame!

[astonished]  Nonsense! [With some remorse] My poor boy, did you think I was angry with you?
[amazed]  Only a--
[troubled]  I have thought sometimes that perhaps I ought; but really, mother, I know so little about them; and what I do know is so painful--it is so impossible to mention some things to you--[he stops, ashamed].
[complacently]  Yes: I have made a very good match for Sarah. Charles Lomax will be a millionaire at 35. But that is ten years ahead; and in the meantime his trustees cannot under the terms of his father's will allow him more than 800 pounds a year.
[ashamed]  Do you mean for--for--for--
[desperately]  I daresay we have been the very imperfect children of a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me alone for once, and tell me about this horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son.
[amazed]  Another son! I never said anything of the kind. I never dreamt of such a thing. This is what comes of interrupting me.
[dubiously]  I am afraid I should make a poor hand of managing a cannon foundry.
[touched]  That's my own boy [she pats his cheek]! Your father never could answer that: he used to laugh and get out of it under cover of some affectionate nonsense. And now that you understand the situation, what do you advise me to do?
[shocked]  I never knew that.
[bitterly]  We are utterly dependent on him and his cannons, then!
[sharply]  Stephen!
[obstinately]  I would die sooner than ask him for another penny.
[resignedly]  You mean that I must ask him. Very well, Stephen: It shall be as you wish. You will be glad to know that your grandfather concurs. But he thinks I ought to ask Andrew to come here and see the girls. After all, he must have some natural affection for them.
[reluctantly]  I suppose so, if the girls cannot do without his money.
[forcibly]  Barbara: I will not have Charles called Cholly: the vulgarity of it positively makes me ill.
[calling]  Come in, Cholly. [Lomax enters, controlling his features very imperfectly, and places himself vaguely between Sarah and Barbara].
[peremptorily]  Sit down, all of you. [They sit. Cusins crosses to the window and seats himself there. Lomax takes a chair. Barbara sits at the writing table and Sarah on the settee]. I don't in the least know what you are laughing at, Adolphus. I am surprised at you, though I expected nothing better from Charles Lomax.
[sweetly]  You were not present. It was really funny, I believe.
[remonstrating]  Oh I say!
[frigidly]  What do you wish to convey, Charles?
[cautiously]  If I may say so, Lady Brit, I think Charles has rather happily expressed what we all feel. Homer, speaking of Autolycus, uses the same phrase.
[handsomely]  Not that I mind, you know, if Sarah don't.
[crushingly]  Thank you. Have I your permission, Adolphus, to invite my own husband to my own house?
[gallantly]  You have my unhesitating support in everything you do.
[chuckling]  I wonder how the old man will take it.
[abashed]  I didn't mean--at least--
[impatiently]  Now I have forgotten what I was going to say. That comes of your provoking me to be sarcastic, Charles. Adolphus: will you kindly tell me where I was.
[sweetly]  You were saying that as Mr Undershaft has not seen his children since they were babies, he will form his opinion of the way you have brought them up from their behavior to-night, and that therefore you wish us all to be particularly careful to conduct ourselves well, especially Charles.
[vehemently]  I did, Charles. Adolphus's recollection is perfectly correct. It is most important that you should be good; and I do beg you for once not to pair off into opposite corners and giggle and whisper while I am speaking to your father.
[apologetically]  I AM somewhat older. [With a touch of courtship] Time has stood still with you.
[promptly]  Rubbish! This is your family.
[surprised]  Is it so large? I am sorry to say my memory is failing very badly in some things. [He offers his hand with paternal kindness to Lomax].
[remonstrating]  No but look here don't you know--[Overcome] Oh I say!
[decisively]  Andrew: you are talking nonsense. Of course you have only one son.
[bowing]  Happy to make your acquaintance, Mr Stephen. Then [going to Cusins] you must be my son. [Taking Cusins' hands in his] How are you, my young friend? [To Lady Britomart] He is very like you, my love.
[submissively]  Yes, my dear: I daresay that will be best. [Making himself comfortable] Well, here I am. Now what can I do for you all?
[outraged]  Charles Lomax: if you can behave yourself, behave yourself. If not, leave the room.
[encouragingly]  Nobody'd know it, I assure you. You look all right, you know.
[delighted]  Are you? Then I'll get it. [He   goes upstairs for the instrument].
[shocked]  But not your sort of blood and fire, you know.
[scandalized]  Oh I say!
[hastily]  I'm not saying anything against you personally, you know.
[leniently]  Well, the more destructive war becomes, the sooner it will be abolished, eh?
[overtaxed]  Would you mind saying that again? I didn't quite follow it.
[rising]  Oh I say!
[rising]  I am afraid I must be going.
[Rising]  Come along. Come, Dolly. Come, Cholly. [She goes out with Undershaft, who opens the door for her. Cusins rises].
[continuing]  But you, Adolphus, can behave yourself if you choose to. I insist on your staying.
[offended]  Well, go. [He starts for the door]. And remember this, Adolphus [he turns to listen]: I have a very strong suspicion that you went to the Salvation Army to worship Barbara and nothing else. And I quite appreciate the very clever way in which you systematically humbug me. I have found you out. Take care Barbara doesn't. That's all.
[languidly]  Very well, mamma. [She goes].
[violently]  I won't be consoled, Stephen. There is nothing the matter with me. [She rises and goes towards the door].
[sceptically]  Yus, I dessay.
[shocked]  Used you to beat your mother?
[gaily]  Keep up your old art! Never say die!
[cheerfully]  No good jawrin about it. You're ony a jumped-up, jerked-off, orspittle-turned-out incurable of an ole workin man: who cares about you? Eh? Make the thievin swine give you a meal: they've stole many a one from you. Get a bit o your own back. [Jenny returns with the usual meal]. There you are, brother. Awsk a blessin an tuck that into you.
[eagerly]  Yes, yes: that's true. I can pay you back: it's only a loan. [Shivering] Oh Lord! oh Lord! [He turns to the table and attacks the meal ravenously].
[fervently]  Glory Hallelujah!
[stung]  You lie, you old soupkitchener, you. There was a young man here. Did I offer to hit him or did I not?
[sullenly]  I'm no music hall wrastler. Can he box?
[checked]  Garn!
[guessing]  I know. Secularist?
[hotly]  Did I offer to deny it?
[insolently]  Wot's that to you?
[defiantly]  Yes, it was me that cut her lip. I ain't afraid o you.
[sullenly]  I want none o your cantin jaw. I suppose you think I come here to beg from you, like this damaged lot here. Not me. I don't want your bread and scrape and catlap. I don't believe in your Gawd, no more than you do yourself.
[considering]  Well, you see, there's no use putting down your name unless I can do something for you, is there? What's your trade?
[complacently]  You see I was right about your trade. [Bill, on the point of retorting furiously, finds himself, to his great shame and terror, in danger of crying instead. He sits down again suddenly]. What's her name?
[dogged]  Er name's Mog Abbijam: thats wot her name is.
[surprised]  Wottud she wash it for, the carroty slut? It's red.
[sullenly]  I ain't afraid of him. I ain't afraid of ennybody. But he can lick me. She's done me. [He sits down moodily on the edge of the horse trough].
[calling]  Jenny!
[critically]  It was as hard as he could hit, I expect. Poor Bill! You don't feel angry with him, do you?
[savagely]  Don't you talk to me, d'ye hear. You lea me alone, or I'll do you a mischief. I'm not dirt under your feet, anyway.
[calmly]  Don't you be afeerd. You ain't such prime company that you need expect to be sought after. [He is about to go into the shelter when Barbara comes out, with Undershaft on her right].
[startled]  A Secularist! Not the least in the world: on the contrary, a confirmed mystic.
[gravely]  Poverty, my friend, is not a thing to be proud of.
[angrily]  Who made your millions for you? Me and my like. What's kep us poor? Keepin you rich. I wouldn't have your conscience, not for all your income.
[bitterly]  Yes: I'm in their debt for a meal, ain't I?
[blustering]  Make a man o ME! Ain't I a man? eh? ain't I a man? Who sez I'm not a man?
[tormented]  Av done with it, I tell you. Chock it. I'm sick of your Jenny Ill and er silly little face.
[fervently]  Gawd elp im! Gawd elp im!
[reflectively]  Yes: I think you're right, Mr Walker. Yes: I should do it. It's curious: it's exactly what an ancient Greek would have done.
[declaiming] 
[triumphantly]  Aha! Barbara Undershaft would be. Her inspiration comes from within herself.
[rising]  And not on Trade Unionism nor Socialism. Excellent.
[revolted]  You really are an infernal old rascal.
[rebounding]  No: don't comfort me. It will be all right. We shall get the money.
[doggedly]  I did wot I said I'd do. I spit in is eye. E looks up at the sky and sez, "O that I should be fahnd worthy to be spit upon for the gospel's sake!" a sez; an Mog sez "Glory Allelloolier!"; an then a called me Brother, an dahned me as if I was a kid and a was me mother washin me a Setterda nawt. I adn't just no show wiv im at all. Arf the street prayed; an the tother arf larfed fit to split theirselves. [To Barbara] There! are you settisfawd nah?
[fiercely]  Don't you go bein sorry for me: you've no call. Listen ere. I broke your jawr.
[distressed]  Oh no--
[impatiently]  Tell y'I did: cawn't you listen to wot's bein told you? All I got be it was bein made a sight of in the public street for me pains. Well, if I cawn't settisfaw you one way, I can another. Listen ere! I ad two quid saved agen the frost; an I've a pahnd of it left. A mate n mine last week ad words with the Judy e's goin to marry. E give er wot-for; an e's bin fined fifteen bob. E ad a right to it er because they was goin to be marrid; but I adn't no right to it you; so put anather fawv bob on an call it a pahnd's worth. [He produces a sovereign]. Ere's the money. Take it; and let's av no more o your forgivin an prayin and your Major jawrin me. Let wot I done be done and paid for; and let there be a end of it.
[contemptuously]  Not likely. I'd give her anather as soon as look at er. Let her av the lawr o me as she threatened! She ain't forgiven me: not mach. Wot I done to er is not on me mawnd--wot she [indicating Barbara] might call on me conscience--no more than stickin a pig. It's this Christian game o yours that I won't av played agen me: this bloomin forgivin an noggin an jawrin that makes a man that sore that iz lawf's a burdn to im. I won't av it, I tell you; so take your money and stop throwin your silly bashed face hup agen me.
[bitterly]  I know. It ain't enough. Me an me few shillins is not good enough for you. You're a earl's grendorter, you are. Nothin less than a underd pahnd for you.
[sullenly]  I cawn't stend aht agen music all wrastlers and artful tongued women. I've offered to pay. I can do no more. Take it or leave it. There it is. [He throws the sovereign on the drum, and sits down on the horse-trough. The coin fascinates Snobby Price, who takes an early opportunity of dropping his cap on it].
[astonished]  Why not, dear?
[impishly]  Pure self-sacrifice on Bodger's part, clearly! Bless dear Bodger! [Barbara almost breaks down as Adolpbus, too, fails her].
[quietly]  Father: come here.
[taunting]  Wot prawce Selvytion nah?
[unshamed]  So I would, mate, and often av, cheerful. But she cawn't buy me. [Approaching Barbara] You wanted my soul, did you? Well, you ain't got it.
[salvationproof]  It's no good: you cawn't get rahnd me nah. I don't blieve in it; and I've seen today that I was right. [Going] So long, old soupkitchener! Ta, ta, Major Earl's Grendorter! [Turning at the gate] Wot prawce Selvytion nah? Snobby Prawce! Ha! ha!
[urgently]  Yes, yes: you must talk to me. Tell me about Tom Paine's books and Bradlaugh's lectures. Come along.
[patiently]  No. I have been making a night of it with the nominal head of this household: that is all.
[disingenuously]  Well--er--well, possibly, as a collector of religions--
[cunningly]  Not as a drummer, though, you know. You are a very clearheaded brainy chap, Cholly; and it must have been apparent to you that there is a certain amount of tosh about--
[overwhelmed]  You are so awfully strong-minded, Lady Brit--
[rising]  Don't be sentimental, Andrew. Sit down. [She sits on the settee: he sits beside her, on her left. She comes to the point before he has time to breathe]. Sarah must have 800 pounds a year until Charles Lomax comes into his property. Barbara will need more, and need it permanently, because Adolphus hasn't any property.
[resignedly]  Yes, my dear: I will see to it. Anything else? for yourself, for instance?
[pouting]  Then go away.
[deprecatory]  Go away!
[obstinately]  There is Stephen.
[disconcerted]  It won't stay unless it's pinned [he fumbles at it with childish grimaces]--
[coldly]  Good afternoon.
[sulkily]  I understand you want to come into the cannon business.
[rising]  My dear boy: this is an immense relief to me. And I trust it may prove an equally good thing for the country. I was afraid you would consider yourself disparaged and slighted. [He moves towards Stephen as if to shake hands with him].
[stiffly]  Mother: there must be an end of treating me as a child, if you please. [Lady Britomart recoils, deeply wounded by his tone]. Until last night I did not take your attitude seriously, because I did not think you meant it seriously. But I find now that you left me in the dark as to matters which you should have explained to me years ago. I am extremely hurt and offended. Any further discussion of my intentions had better take place with my father, as between one man and another.
[uneasily]  What do you think he had better do, Andrew?
[vaguely]  Ahdedoo.
[Magnanimously]  Oh well, yes: I'll come. That is, if there is room for me.
[scandalized]  My dear! It is a spotlessly clean and beautiful hillside town.
[revolted]  You really are a--well, what I was saying yesterday.
[embarrassed]  Mother--
[enthusiastically]  Have you two seen the place? Why did you leave us?
[diplomatically]  Not quite. [They all turn and stare at him. He comes from the platform past the shed to Undershaft]. I think--Mind! I am not committing myself in any way as to my future course--but I think the foundling difficulty can be got over.
[thoughtfully]  Biddy: this may be a way out of the difficulty.
[peremptorily]  Mr Undershaft: you have my terms. Take them or leave them.
[disgusted]  Half!
[firmly]  Half.
[determinedly]  No: none of that. You must keep the true faith of an Armorer, or you don't come in here.
[enigmatically]  A will of which I am a part.
[startled]  Father! Do you know what you are saying; or are you laying a snare for my soul?
[hypnotized]  Before I joined the Salvation Army, I was in my own power; and the consequence was that I never knew what to do with myself. When I joined it, I had not time enough for all the things I had to do.
[approvingly]  Just so. And why was that, do you suppose?
[revolted]  You saved my soul! What do you mean?
[bewildered]  The seven deadly sins!
[punctured]  My dear: I have no other means of conveying my ideas.
[rising]  Children: come home instantly. Andrew: I am exceedingly sorry I allowed you to call on us. You are wickeder than ever. Come at once.
[unruffled]  Well, where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered, don't you know. [To Undershaft] Eh? What?
[violently]  Don't dare call me Biddy. Charles Lomax: you are a fool. Adolphus Cusins: you are a Jesuit. Stephen: you are a prig. Barbara: you are a lunatic. Andrew: you are a vulgar tradesman. Now you all know my opinion; and my conscience is clear, at all events [she sits down again with a vehemence that almost wrecks the chair].
[grinning]  I may not be able to control my affections, Mac.
[starting]  Plato! You dare quote Plato to me!
[firmly]  Not on any account. I will see the whole establishment blown up with its own dynamite before I will get up at five. My hours are healthy, rational hours eleven to five.
[Calling]  Bilton! [He turns to Lady Britomart, who rises]. My dear: let us leave these two young people to themselves for a moment. [Bilton comes from the shed]. I am going to take you through the gun cotton shed.
[unmoved]  No, ma'am. Mr Undershaft has the other gentleman's matches in his pocket.
[abruptly]  Oh! I beg your pardon. [She goes into the shed].
[Emotionally]  I am very proud of my father. I-- [Unable to proceed, he presses Cusins' hand and goes hastily into the shed, followed by Bilton].
[overjoyed]  Then you--you--you-- Oh for my drum! [He flourishes imaginary drumsticks].
[gasping]  Middle cl--! A snub! A social snub to ME! from the daughter of a foundling!
[Dogmatically.]  The proper way to keep teeth good is to give them plenty of use on bones and nuts, and wash them every day with soap-- plain yellow soap.
[Agitated.]  Finch: I cannot bring myself to tell them. I-- (She is interrupted by the twins and Gloria. Dolly comes tearing up the steps, racing Philip, who combines a terrific speed with unhurried propriety of bearing which, however, costs him the race, as Dolly reaches her mother first and almost upsets the garden seat by the precipitancy of her arrival.)
[Calling]  William!
[Bitterly.]  The head of the table!
[Rising.]  Well: shall we run away?
[Severely.]  Mr. Valentine: you are one of those men who play with women's affections.
[Pointedly.]  Bullies are always cowards. (He goes disgustedly towards the window.)

[hopefully]  I can give you change for a tanner, kind lady.
[protesting]  Who's trying to deceive you? I called him Freddy or Charlie same as you might yourself if you was talking to a stranger and wished to be pleasant. [She sits down beside her basket].
[suspiciously]  Who told you my people come from Selsey?
[appalled]  Oh, what harm is there in my leaving Lisson Grove? It wasn't fit for a pig to live in; and I had to pay four-and-six a week. [In tears] Oh, boo--hoo--oo--
[promptly]  Hoxton.
[amazed]  Well, who said I didn't? Bly me! You know everything, you do.
[violently]  Will you please keep your impertinent remarks to yourself?
[helpfully]  _H_anwell.
[explosively]  Woman: cease this detestable boohooing instantly; or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship.
[eagerly]  Are you? Do you know Colonel Pickering, the author of Spoken Sanscrit?
[returning]  This is the young woman, sir.
[stupent]  WELL!!! [Recovering his breath with a gasp] What do you expect me to say to you?
[gently]  What is it you want, my girl?
[peremptorily]  Sit down.
[severely]  Sit down, girl. Do as you're told. [She places the stray chair near the hearthrug between Higgins and Pickering, and stands behind it waiting for the girl to sit down].
[coyly]  Don't mind if I do. [She sits down. Pickering returns to the hearthrug].
[haughtily]  Who told you I only--
[continuing]  She offers me two-fifths of her day's income for a lesson. Two-fifths of a millionaire's income for a day would be somewhere about 60 pounds. It's handsome. By George, it's enormous! it's the biggest offer I ever had.
[weeping]  But I ain't got sixty pounds. Oh--
[laughing]  He did. I think it must be regarded as her property, Mrs. Pearce.
[uneasy]  Oh, don't say that, sir: there's more ways than one of turning a girl's head; and nobody can do it better than Mr. Higgins, though he may not always mean it. I do hope, sir, you won't encourage him to do anything foolish.
[resolutely]  You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins: really you must. You can't walk over everybody like this.
[patiently]  What's the matter?
[whimpering]  Nah--ow. You got no right to touch me.
[Impatiently]  What on earth will she want with money? She'll have her food and her clothes. She'll only drink if you give her money.
[impatiently]  What's to become of her if I leave her in the gutter? Tell me that, Mrs. Pearce.
[overwhelmed]  Ah--ah--ow--oo!
[patiently]  I think you'd better let me speak to the girl properly in private. I don't know that I can take charge of her or consent to the arrangement at all. Of course I know you don't mean her any harm; but when you get what you call interested in people's accents, you never think or care what may happen to them or you. Come with me, Eliza.
[moodily]  Have you ever met a man of good character where women are concerned?
[eagerly]  Well, Mrs. Pearce: is it all right?
[sternly]  Of course. I'm always particular about what I say. Why do you say this to me?
[unmoved]  No, sir: you're not at all particular when you've mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient. Now it doesn't matter before me: I'm used to it. But you really must not swear before the girl.
[indignantly]  I swear! [Most emphatically] I never swear. I detest the habit. What the devil do you mean?
[stolidly]  That's what I mean, sir. You swear a great deal too much. I don't mind your damning and blasting, and what the devil and where the devil and who the devil--
[loftily]  I cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it, Mrs. Pearce. [She looks at him steadfastly. He adds, hiding an uneasy conscience with a judicial air] Except perhaps in a moment of extreme and justifiable excitement.
[yelling]  Oh very well, very well: I'll wipe them in my hair in future.
[rising]  Phew! I say! [He retreats to the hearthrug].
[promptly]  Send the blackguard up.
[confidently]  Oh no: I think not. If there's any trouble he shall have it with me, not I with him. And we are sure to get something interesting out of him.
[menacingly]  I want my daughter: that's what I want. See?
[remonstrating]  Now, now, look here, Governor.  Is this reasonable? Is it fair to take advantage of a man like this? The girl belongs to me. You got her. Where do I come in? [He sits down again].
[protesting]  No, Governor.
[sweetly]  Well, what would a man come for? Be human, governor.
[disarmed]  Alfred: did you put her up to it?
[determinedly]  You're going to take her away, double quick. [He crosses to the hearth and rings the bell].
[rising]  No, Governor. Don't say that. I'm not the man to stand in my girl's light. Here's a career opening for her, as you might say; and--
[desperate]  Where's the clothes she come in? Did I burn them or did your missus here?
[revolted]  Do you mean to say, you callous rascal, that you would sell your daughter for 50 pounds?
[unabashed]  Can't afford them, Governor. Neither could you if you was as poor as me. Not that I mean any harm, you know. But if Liza is going to have a bit out of this, why not me too?
[troubled]  I don't know what to do, Pickering. There can be no question that as a matter of morals it's a positive crime to give this chap a farthing. And yet I feel a sort of rough justice in his claim.
[conscientiously]  Oh! Quite right, Mrs. Pearce. [To Eliza] Yes: damned silly.
[blandly]  Oh, nothing, sir. It doesn't matter.
[impressively]  Stop. You'll come regularly to see your daughter. It's your duty, you know. My brother is a clergyman; and he could help you in your talks with her.
[evasively]  Certainly. I'll come, Governor. Not just this week, because I have a job at a distance. But later on you may depend on me. Afternoon, gentlemen. Afternoon, ma'am. [He takes off his hat to Mrs. Pearce, who disdains the salutation and goes out. He winks at Higgins, thinking him probably a fellow sufferer from Mrs. Pearce's difficult disposition, and follows her].
[dismayed]  Henry [scolding him]! What are you doing here to-day? It is my at home day: you promised not to come. [As he bends to kiss her, she takes his hat off, and presents it to him].
[impatiently]  Well, she must talk about something. [He controls himself and sits down again]. Oh, she'll be all right: don't you fuss. Pickering is in it with me. I've a sort of bet on that I'll pass her off as a duchess in six months. I started on her some months ago; and she's getting on like a house on fire. I shall win my bet. She has a quick ear; and she's been easier to teach than my middle-class pupils because she's had to learn a complete new language. She talks English almost as you talk French.
[introducing]  My son Henry.
[gaily]  I don't. [She sits in the Elizabethan chair].
[Introducing]  Colonel Pickering.
[bowing]  Ahdedo?
[resignedly]  It don't matter, anyhow. Sit down. He shakes Freddy's hand, and almost slings him on the ottoman with his face to the windows; then comes round to the other side of it.
[gaily]  Is it so very cynical?
[seriously]  Oh! I'm sure you don't mean that, Mr. Higgins.
[warningly]  Or of manners, Henry?
[cordially]  Quite right: I'm very glad indeed to see you.
[introducing]  My daughter Clara.
[impulsively]  How do you do? [She sits down on the ottoman beside Eliza, devouring her with her eyes].
[introducing]  My son Freddy.
[suddenly]  By George, yes: it all comes back to me! [They stare at him]. Covent Garden! [Lamentably] What a damned thing!
[sulkily]  Sorry.
[darkly]  My aunt died of influenza: so they said.
[puzzled]  Done her in?
[startled]  Dear me!
[hastily]  Oh, that's the new small talk. To do a person in means to kill them.
[Cheerfully]  On the burst, as you might say, from time to time. And always more agreeable when he had a drop in. When he was out of work, my mother used to give him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until he'd drunk himself cheerful and loving-like. There's lots of women has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with. [Now quite at her ease] You see, it's like this. If a man has a bit of a conscience, it always takes him when he's sober; and then it makes him low-spirited. A drop of booze just takes that off and makes him happy. [To Freddy, who is in convulsions of suppressed laughter] Here! what are you sniggering at?
[interposing]  Not at all, Miss Doolittle.
[Expansively]  What I always say is--
[rising]  Well, after that, I think it's time for us to go.
[rising]  Oh yes: we have three at homes to go to still. Good-bye, Mrs. Higgins. Good-bye, Colonel Pickering. Good-bye, Professor Higgins.
[convulsively]  Clara!
[eagerly]  Yes, I should, most awfully.
[eagerly]  Well? Is Eliza presentable [he swoops on his mother and drags her to the ottoman, where she sits down in Eliza's place with her son on her left]?
[aggrieved]  Do you mean that my language is improper?
[sulkily]  Oh, well, if you say so, I suppose I don't always talk like a bishop.
[slowly]  I think I know what you mean, Mrs. Higgins.
[fervently]  Thank God it's over!
[Rising]  However, it's over and done with; and now I can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow.
[astounded]  What on earth--! [He comes to her]. What's the matter? Get up. [He pulls her up]. Anything wrong?
[breathless]  Nothing wrong--with YOU. I've won your bet for you, haven't I? That's enough for you. _I_ don't matter, I suppose.
[thundering]  THOSE slippers.
[impatiently]  Well, don't you thank God it's all over? Now you are free and can do what you like.
[Chuckling]  He'll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today; and that, with the hire of the jewellery, will make a big hole in two hundred pounds. Why, six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own. Come! you'll be all right. I must clear off to bed: I'm devilish sleepy. By the way, I came down for something: I forget what it was.
[furious]  Hand them over. [She puts them into his hands]. If these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler, I'd ram them down your ungrateful throat. [He perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets, unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains].
[pertly]  You'd better leave a note for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee; for she won't be told by me.
[formally]  Damn Mrs. Pearce; and damn the coffee; and damn you; and damn my own folly in having lavished MY hard-earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe. [He goes out with impressive decorum, and spoils it by slamming the door savagely].
[announcing]  Mr. Doolittle. [She withdraws].
[tolerantly]  A little of both, Henry, like the rest of us: a little of both.
[amazed]  Upstairs!!! Then I shall jolly soon fetch her downstairs. [He makes resolutely for the door].
[astonished]  But why? What did we do to her?
[ironically]  Quite sure?
[impatiently]  But she knew all about that. We didn't make speeches to her, if that's what you mean.
[furious]  Is she, by George? Ho!
[remonstrating]  Now, now, Henry Higgins! have some consideration for my feelings as a middle class man.
[choking]  Am I-- [He can say no more].
[placidly]  Yes, dear; but you'll sit down, won't you?
[impulsively]  No.
[trivially]  Of course: that is his profession.
[continuing]  It was just like learning to dance in the fashionable way: there was nothing more than that in it. But do you know what began my real education?
[laughing]  Why don't you slang back at him? Don't stand it. It would do him a lot of good.
[rising]  Forgive! Will she, by George! Let her go. Let her find out how she can get on without us. She will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow.
[angrily]  You're going to let yourself down to marry that low common woman!
[quietly]  He ought to, Eliza. [To Doolittle] Why has she changed her mind?
[sadly]  Intimidated, Governor. Intimidated. Middle class morality claims its victim. Won't you put on your hat, Liza, and come and see me turned off?
[rising]  I'll order the carriage and get ready. [The men rise, except Higgins]. I shan't be more than fifteen minutes. [As she goes to the door Eliza comes in, hatted and buttoning her gloves]. I'm going to the church to see your father married, Eliza. You had better come in the brougham with me. Colonel Pickering can go on with the bridegroom.
[coaxing]  Do stay with us, Eliza. [He follows Doolittle].
[irritated]  The question is not whether I treat you rudely, but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better.
[earnestly]  Don't you try to get round me. You'll HAVE to do without me.
[arrogant]  I can do without anybody. I have my own soul: my own spark of divine fire. But [with sudden humility] I shall miss you, Eliza. [He sits down near her on the ottoman]. I have learnt something from your idiotic notions: I confess that humbly and gratefully. And I have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like them, rather.
[heartily]  Why, because it was my job.
[gently]  Than he is: not "than what he is."
[reflectively]  I don't suppose Pickering would, though. He's as confirmed an old bachelor as I am.
[desperate]  Oh, you are a cruel tyrant. I can't talk to you: you turn everything against me: I'm always in the wrong. But you know very well all the time that you're nothing but a bully. You know I can't go back to the gutter, as you call it, and that I have no real friends in the world but you and the Colonel. You know well I couldn't bear to live with a low common man after you two; and it's wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending I could. You think I must go back to Wimpole Street because I have nowhere else to go but father's. But don't you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down. I'll marry Freddy, I will, as soon as he's able to support me.
[disdainfully]  Buy them yourself. [She sweeps out].
[sunnily]  Oh, don't bother. She'll buy em all right enough. Good-bye.
[Dramatiska]  Theatre in Stockholm. When the new National Theatre was opened in Christiania in 1899, _Gengangere_ found an early place in its repertory; and even the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen has since opened its doors to the tragedy.
[private]  performance in Berlin took place on January 9, 1887, at the Residenz Theater; and when the Freie Bühne, founded on the model of the Paris Theatre Libre, began its operations two years later (September 29, 1889), _Gespenster_ was the first play that it produced. The Freie Bühne gave the initial impulse to the whole modern movement which has given Germany a new dramatic literature; and the leaders of the movement, whether authors or critics, were one and all ardent disciples of Ibsen, who regarded _Gespenster_ as his typical masterpiece. In Germany, then, the play certainly did, in Ibsen's own words, "move some boundary-posts." The Prussian censorship presently withdrew its veto, and on November 27, 1894, the two leading literary theatres of Berlin, the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, gave simultaneous performances of the tragedy. Everywhere in Germany and Austria it is now freely performed; but it is naturally one of the least popular of Ibsen's plays.

[Ibsen's]  letters, and a photograph which he had presented to Holm. Ibsen brooded and brooded over the incident, and at last came to the conclusion that the young man had intended to return her letters and photograph to a young lady to whom he was known to be attached, and had in a fit of aberration mixed up the two objects of his worship. Some time after, Holm appeared at Ibsen's rooms. He talked quite rationally, but professed to have no knowledge whatever of the letter-incident, though he admitted the truth of Ibsen's conjecture that the "belle dame sans merci" had demanded the return of her letters and portrait. Ibsen was determined to get at the root of the mystery; and a little inquiry into his young friend's habits revealed the fact that he broke his fast on a bottle of port wine, consumed a bottle of Rhine wine at lunch, of Burgundy at dinner, and finished off the evening with one or two more bottles of port. Then he heard, too, how, in the course of a night's carouse, Holm had lost the manuscript of a book; and in these traits he saw the outline of the figure of Eilert Lovborg.

[Languidly_._]   I don't know that I am much interested in your family life, Lane.
[Stiffly_._]   I believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five o'clock.  Where have you been since last Thursday?
[Airily_._]   Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
[Sententiously.]   That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.
[Gravely.]   There were no cucumbers in the market this morning, sir.  I went down twice.
[Frowning.]   I hope not, Algernon.  It would put my table completely out.  Your uncle would have to dine upstairs. Fortunately he is accustomed to that.
[Nervously.]   Miss Fairfax, ever since I met you I have admired you more than any girl . . . I have ever met since . . . I met you.
[Glibly.]   Ah! that is clearly a metaphysical speculation, and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual facts of real life, as we know them.
[Astounded.]   Well . . . surely.  You know that I love you, and you led me to believe, Miss Fairfax, that you were not absolutely indifferent to me.
[Reproachfully.]   Mamma!
[Sternly.]   Both, if necessary, I presume.  What are your politics?
[Gravely.]   In a hand-bag.
[Irritably.]   Oh!  It always is nearly seven.
[Calling.]   Cecily, Cecily!  Surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather Moulton's duty than yours?  Especially at a moment when intellectual pleasures await you. Your German grammar is on the table.  Pray open it at page fifteen.  We will repeat yesterday's lesson.
[Smiling.]   But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up through the garden.
[Bowing.]   A classical allusion merely, drawn from the Pagan authors.  I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?
[Sententiously.]   That is obviously the reason why the Primitive Church has not lasted up to the present day.  And you do not seem to realise, dear Doctor, that by persistently remaining single, a man converts himself into a permanent public temptation.  Men should be more careful; this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray.
[Bitterly.]   People who live entirely for pleasure usually are.
[Nervously.] 
[Rising.]   I might respect you, Ernest, I might admire your character, but I fear that I should not be able to give you my undivided attention.
[Severely.]   Really?  Your mother, no doubt, or some female relative of advanced years, resides here also?
[Inquiringly.]   I beg your pardon?
[Meditatively.]   If the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise I shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once, and with a firm hand.
[Satirically.]   I am glad to say that I have never seen a spade.  It is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different.
[Sweetly.]   I suppose that is why you live in town?  [Gwendolen bites her lip, and beats her foot nervously with her parasol.]
[Sweetly.]   Sugar?
[Superciliously.]   No, thank you.  Sugar is not fashionable any more. [Cecily looks angrily at her, takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup.]
[Severely.]   Cake or bread and butter?
[Rising.]   To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy from the machinations of any other girl there are no lengths to which I would not go.
[Laughing.]   To dear little Cecily!  Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
[Receding.]   Jack!  Oh!
[Laughing.]   Of course not!  What could have put such an idea into your pretty little head?
[Surprised.]   No brother at all?
[Cheerily.]   None!
[Severely.]   Had you never a brother of any kind?
[Pleasantly.]   Never.  Not even of any kind.
[Rising.] 
[Rising.]   Well, that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy way. [Takes muffins from Algernon.]
[Stammering.]   Oh!  No!  Bunbury doesn't live here.  Bunbury is somewhere else at present.  In fact, Bunbury is dead.
[Airily.]   Oh!  I killed Bunbury this afternoon.  I mean poor Bunbury died this afternoon.
[Grimly.]   I have known strange errors in that publication.
[Starting.]   Miss Prism!  Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
[Severely.]   I am a celibate, madam.
[Interposing.]   Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has been for the last three years Miss Cardew's esteemed governess and valued companion.
[Calmly.]   It seems to be mine.  Yes, here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a Gower Street omnibus in younger and happier days.  Here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage, an incident that occurred at Leamington.  And here, on the lock, are my initials.  I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood I had had them placed there.  The bag is undoubtedly mine.  I am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me.  It has been a great inconvenience being without it all these years.
[Amazed.]   You?
[Irritably.]   Yes, but what was my father's Christian name?
[Meditatively.]   I cannot at the present moment recall what the General's Christian name was.  But I have no doubt he had one. He was eccentric, I admit.  But only in later years.  And that was the result of the Indian climate, and marriage, and indigestion, and other things of that kind.
[Enthusiastically.]   Frederick!  At last!
[_Languidly_.]   And were you interested?
[_Rising_.]   And how well it becomes us, Olivia!
[_Smiling_.]   I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.
[_Gravely_.]   I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!
[_Genially_.]   Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don’t they?  It is most fashionable.  [_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.] Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?
[_Superciliously_.]   Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.
[_Coldly_.]   I am not surprised!
[_Bowing_.]   Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about nothing else.
[_Smiling_.]   And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?
[_Rises_.]   And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim—you remember the Baron?—used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.
[_Smiling_.]   Intimately.  Did you?
[_Bowing_.]   I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.
[_Approaching_.]   Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.
[_Severely_.]   The music is in German.  You would not understand it.
[_Emphatically_.]   Yes, always to others, have we not?
[_Smiling_.]   And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London.
[_Stiffly_.]   Please don’t praise other women in our presence.  You might wait for us to do that!
[_Coldly_.]   I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte. [_The_ VICOMTE _is about to retire_.  LADY BASILDON, _seeing this_, _rises at once and takes his arm_.]  But I will come down with you with pleasure.
[_Languidly_.]   Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.  [_Rises hastily and takes his arm_.]  But I will sit beside you, and watch you.
[_Severely_.]   Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public!
[_Frowning_.]   Ah! yes.  I remember hearing, at the time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.
[_Rising_.]   But you have not seen my Corots yet. They are in the music-room.  Corots seem to go with music, don’t they? May I show them to you?
[_Coldly_.]   Pray allow me to believe that you are not.
[_Contemptuously_.]   The letter you wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Radley’s secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal shares—a letter written three days before the Government announced its own purchase.
[_Hoarsely_.]   It is not true.
[_Gently_.]   A secret?  Between whom?
[_Entering_.]   Your carriage is here, Mrs. Cheveley!
[_Eagerly_.]   Oh, pray do!  I have been waiting for it all the evening.
[_Exit_.] 
[_Exit_] 
[_Starting_.]   Who told you I intended to do so?
[_Sadly_.]   One’s past is what one is.  It is the only way by which people should be judged.
[_Stopping_.]   In the present case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed my mind.  That is all.
[_Sternly_.]   Yes!
[_Slowly_.]   Yes; most men would call it ugly names.  There is no doubt of that.
[_Bitterly_.]   Men who every day do something of the same kind themselves.  Men who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their own lives.
[_Excitedly_.]   I did not sell myself for money.  I bought success at a great price.  That is all.
[_Gravely_.]   Yes; you certainly paid a great price for it. But what first made you think of doing such a thing?
[_Rising_.]   I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.
[_Sadly_.]   You thought you had won.
[_Airily_.]   Oh, I forget.  At least, it makes no matter. By the way, have you tried her with money?  She used to be confoundedly fond of money.
[_Writing_.]   Why do you say that?
[_Smiling_.]   I wonder.
[_Strongly_.]   Oh, fight in any case—in any case.
[_Smiling_.]   Of which you know so little, Lord Goring—
[_Gravely_.]   I hope so.  Why do you look at me so strangely, Lord Goring?
[_Rising_.]   No, Lady Chiltern, I am not a Pessimist. Indeed I am not sure that I quite know what Pessimism really means.  All I do know is that life cannot be understood without much charity, cannot be lived without much charity.  It is love, and not German philosophy, that is the true explanation of this world, whatever may be the explanation of the next.  And if you are ever in trouble, Lady Chiltern, trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way I can.  If you ever want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  Come at once to me.
[_Laughing_.]   You must excuse me, Lady Chiltern.  It won’t occur again, if I can help it.
[_Smiling_.]   I am not so sure.
[_Triumphantly_.]   I am.
[_Rising_.]   Mrs. Cheveley!  Coming to see me? Impossible!
[_Reflecting_.]   You are remarkably modern, Mabel.  A little too modern, perhaps.  Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern. One is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  I have known many instances of it.
[_Smiling_.]   No, lady Markby—a ruby.
[_Coldly_.]   Oh, it has been no inconvenience.  That will do, Mason.  You can bring tea.
[_Languidly_.]   I have never read a Blue Book.  I prefer books . . . in yellow covers.
[_Rising_.]   And now, Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of an hour.  Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, you wouldn’t mind waiting in the carriage while I am with Lady Brancaster.  As I intend it to be a visit of condolence, I shan’t stay long.
[_Rising_.]   I don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all, provided there is somebody to look at one.
[_Rising_.]   Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheveley will stay here a little.  I should like to have a few minutes’ conversation with her.
[_Contemptuously_.]   Like the service you wished to render my husband last night, I suppose.  Thank heaven, I saved him from that.
[_Apologetically_.]   Quite so, father.  I was merely expressing sympathy.
[_Indignantly_.]   If you listen attentively! . . . Conceited young puppy!
[_Gravely_.]   Thank you, madam.
[_Expostulating_.]   My dear father, if I am to get married, surely you will allow me to choose the time, place, and person? Particularly the person.
[_Testily_.]   That is a matter for me, sir.  You would probably make a very poor choice.  It is I who should be consulted, not you.  There is property at stake.  It is not a matter for affection. Affection comes later on in married life.
[_Exit_.] 
[_Rises_.]   Arthur, let me see for myself.
[_Smiling_.]   To-morrow.
[_Rising_.]   The Book of Numbers.
[_Bitterly_.]   I only war against one woman, against Gertrude Chiltern.  I hate her.  I hate her now more than ever.
[_Calmly_.]   Oh, ten years ago, on Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it.
[_Starting_.]   What do you mean?
[_Trembling_.]   The police?  What for?
[_Laughing_.]   ‘I want you.  I trust you.  I am coming to you.  Gertrude.’
[_Bowing_.]   I shall do so, my lord.
[_Genially_.]   Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
[_Caustically_.]   You can have till dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you.
[_Airily_.]   The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.
[_Testily_.]   I hate this affectation of youth, sir.  It is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.
[_Sadly_.]   Then I suppose it is my duty to remain with you?
[_Rapturously_.]   Oh! is it a proposal?
[_Indignantly_.]   The second to-day?  What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you?
[_Enthusiastically_.]   How sweet of you to say so! . . . And it is only fair to tell you frankly that I am fearfully extravagant.
[_Triumphantly_.]   No; that was a flash of genius.
[_Bowing_.]   Good morning, Lady Chiltern!
[_Rising_.]   Lady Chiltern, I will be quite frank with you. Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to send it to your husband.
[_Rising_.]   Oh, I couldn’t, I couldn’t!
[_Gravely_.]   You are wrong, Lady Chiltern.
[_Eagerly_.]   Oh yes, Robert, you should do that.  It is your duty to do that.
[_Sadly_.]   And your ambition for me?  You used to be ambitious for me.
[_Angrily_.]   Decline a seat in the Cabinet, and retire from public life?  Never heard such damned nonsense in the whole course of my existence.  I beg your pardon, Lady Chiltern.  Chiltern, I beg your pardon.  [_To_ LORD GORING.]  Don’t grin like that, sir.
[_Grimly_.]   Not a subject on which much eloquence is possible.
[_Startled_.]   I don’t understand you.
[_Smiling_.]   No; you shall have Mabel.  [_Takes the letter and writes her husband’s name on it_.]
[_Smiling_.]   Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up, that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only things we _can_ pay.
[_Gravely_.]   I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that. But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes think you pretend to be worse.
[_Smiling_.]   Oh, anything is better than being sacrificed!
[_Frowning_.]   Console herself?
[_R.C._]   Oh, don’t say that, Lady Windermere.  I should never be admitted!  [_Sitting_.]
[_Smiling_.]   Ah! you are beginning to reform me.  It is a dangerous thing to reform any one, Lady Windermere.  [_Bows_, _and exit C._]
[_Rises_.] 
[_Smiling_.]   Why, Duchess?
[_Interrupting_.]   Duchess, Duchess, it’s impossible! [_Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.  Our child is but six months old.  [_Sits in chair R. of L. table_.]
[_Rises_.]   And now, my dear child, I must go, as we are dining out.  And mind you don’t take this little aberration of Windermere’s too much to heart.  Just take him abroad, and he’ll come back to you all right.
[_C._] 
[_L.C._]   Yes, dear, these wicked women get our husbands away from us, but they always come back, slightly damaged, of course.  And don’t make scenes, men hate them!
[_Rises_.]   Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a house for her?
[_L._] 
[_L.C._]   Margaret, I was saying to you—and I beg you to listen to me—that as far as I have known Mrs. Erlynne, she has conducted herself well.  If years ago—
[_C._]   I am not going to give you any details about her life.  I tell you simply this—Mrs. Erlynne was once honoured, loved, respected.  She was well born, she had position—she lost everything—threw it away, if you like.  That makes it all the more bitter.  Misfortunes one can endure—they come from outside, they are accidents.  But to suffer for one’s own faults—ah!—there is the sting of life.  It was twenty years ago, too.  She was little more than a girl then.  She had been a wife for even less time than you have.
[_Rises_.] 
[_L.C._]   Margaret, you are talking foolishly, recklessly.  I won’t argue with you, but I insist upon your asking Mrs. Erlynne to-night.
[_R.C._]   I shall do nothing of the kind.  [_Crossing L.C._]
[_C._] 
[_Coldly_.]   Yes, I have seen a good deal of her since then.  I have just seen her.
[_Aside_.]  Berwick and I told her that didn’t matter much, as the lady in question must have an extremely fine figure.  You should have seen Arabella’s expression! . . . But, look here, dear boy.  I don’t know what to do about Mrs. Erlynne.  Egad!  I might be married to her; she treats me with such demmed indifference.  She’s deuced clever, too!  She explains everything.  Egad! she explains you.  She has got any amount of explanations for you—and all of them different.
[_C._]   Margaret!  I _must_ speak to you.
[_R.C._]   Mrs. Erlynne is coming here, and if you in any way annoy or wound her, you will bring shame and sorrow on us both. Remember that!  Ah, Margaret! only trust me!  A wife should trust her husband!
[_C._]   London is full of women who trust their husbands.  One can always recognise them.  They look so thoroughly unhappy.  I am not going to be one of them.  [_Moves up_.]  Lord Darlington, will you give me back my fan, please?  Thanks. . . . A useful thing a fan, isn’t it? . . . I want a friend to-night, Lord Darlington: I didn’t know I would want one so soon.
[_C._]   How do you do, again, Lord Windermere?  How charming your sweet wife looks!  Quite a picture!
[_Smiling_.]   The wisest thing I ever did in my life. And, by the way, you must pay me a good deal of attention this evening. I am afraid of the women.  You must introduce me to some of them.  The men I can always manage.  How do you do, Lord Augustus?  You have quite neglected me lately.  I have not seen you since yesterday.  I am afraid you’re faithless.  Every one told me so.
[_R._]   Now really, Mrs. Erlynne, allow me to explain.
[_R.C._]   No, dear Lord Augustus, you can’t explain anything.  It is your chief charm.
[_R._]   Most kind of you to say these charming things to me!  [MRS. ERLYNNE _smiles_, _and continues conversation_.]
[_Rises_.] 
[_Exit_.] 
[_C._]   Ah, about dear Australia, I suppose?
[_Aside_.]   Did Mr. Hopper definitely—
[_Affectionately_.]   My dear one!  You always say the right thing.  Mr. Hopper!  James!  Agatha has told me everything. How cleverly you have both kept your secret.
[_Indignantly_.]   To Australia?  Oh, don’t mention that dreadful vulgar place.
[_Severely_.]   Did you say that, Agatha?
[_Frowning_.]   Is that what you want to talk to me about to-night?
[_Laughing_.]   Then we will talk of it on the terrace. Even business should have a picturesque background.  Should it not, Windermere?  With a proper background women can do anything.
[_Exit_.] 
[_Nervously_.]   Do what I tell you.  Do what I tell you.
[_Authoritatively_.]   Yes, you must!  There is not a second to be lost.  Lord Darlington may return at any moment.
[_C._]   Lady Windermere, you wrong me horribly—you wrong your husband horribly.  He doesn’t know you are here—he thinks you are safe in your own house.  He thinks you are asleep in your own room.  He never read the mad letter you wrote to him!
[_R._]   Never read it!
[_R.C._]   Your husband has never seen the letter.  I—saw it, I opened it.  I—read it.
[_Slowly_.]   You took good care to burn it before I had examined it.  I cannot trust you.  You, whose whole life is a lie, could you speak the truth about anything?  [_Sits down_.]
[_Hurriedly_.]   Think as you like about me—say what you choose against me, but go back, go back to the husband you love.
[_Sullenly_.]   I do _not_ love him!
[_Rising_.]   Ah! you admit you have a hold!
[_Humbly_.]   Nothing.  I know it—but I tell you that your husband loves you—that you may never meet with such love again in your whole life—that such love you will never meet—and that if you throw it away, the day may come when you will starve for love and it will not be given to you, beg for love and it will be denied you—Oh! Arthur loves you!
[_Outside_.]   Nonsense, dear Windermere, you must not leave me!
[_Aside_.]  Darlington has been moralising and talking about the purity of love, and that sort of thing, and he has got some woman in his rooms all the time.
[_Chuckling_.]   By Jove!  By Jove!
[_Smiling_.]   It is some of your nonsense, Cecil.
[_Aside_.]   She is here after all!
[_Moves_.] 
[_Rising_.]   She is sure to tell him.  I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly, nobly—and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.  Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange!  I would have publicly disgraced her in my own house.  She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women. . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us!  For even if she doesn’t tell, I must.  Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it.  To tell it is to live through it all again.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.  Words are perhaps the worst.  Words are merciless. . . . Oh! [_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]
[_Rises_.]   We can easily catch the 3.40. I’ll send a wire to Fannen.  [_Crosses and sits down at table to write a telegram_.]
[_Rising_.]   It is too late, Arthur, to say that now. [_Moves away_.]
[_Rising_.]   Margaret, if you knew where Mrs. Erlynne went last night, after she left this house, you would not sit in the same room with her.  It was absolutely shameless, the whole thing.
[_Returning_.]   I’m afraid it is very flattering—I am not so pretty as that.  [_Showing photograph_.]
[_Coldly_.]   My daughter, you mean.
[_Rising_.]   Do you count that to his credit, Lord Windermere—or to mine?
[_Rising_.]   I suppose, Windermere, you would like me to retire into a convent, or become a hospital nurse, or something of that kind, as people do in silly modern novels.  That is stupid of you, Arthur; in real life we don’t do such things—not as long as we have any good looks left, at any rate.  No—what consoles one nowadays is not repentance, but pleasure.  Repentance is quite out of date.  And besides, if a woman really repents, she has to go to a bad dressmaker, otherwise no one believes in her.  And nothing in the world would induce me to do that.  No; I am going to pass entirely out of your two lives.  My coming into them has been a mistake—I discovered that last night.
[_Smiling_.]   Almost fatal.
[_Angrily_.]   Then let me beg of you to leave our house at once.  I will make your excuses to Margaret.
[_Pause_.]   You are devoted to your mother’s memory, Lady Windermere, your husband tells me.
[_Pause_.] 
[_Rising_.]   I am afraid I must go now, Lady Windermere.
[_Rising_.]   Oh no, don’t.
[_Coldly_.]   Quite well, thank you, Mrs. Erlynne.
[_Laughing_.]   Of course I do.  You’ll carry it so gracefully.  You would carry off anything gracefully, dear Lord Augustus.
[_Gravely_.]   She is better than one thought her.
[_Frightened_.]   Has Mrs. Erlynne—?
[_Smiling_.]   We have the largest country in the world, Lady Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as big as France and England put together.
[_Exeunt_.] 
[_Exit_.] 
[_Continuing_.]   I couldn’t believe that any women could really hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your guests.  [_An awkward pause_.]
[_Slowly_.]   I suppose there is.
[_Laughing_.]   I might be able to learn how to tie a tie, Lord Illingworth, but I should never be able to talk as you do.  I don’t know how to talk.
[_Rising_.]   I am afraid I must go, Lady Hunstanton. Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny’s bad nights.
[_Rising_.]   Well, I won’t keep you from her.  [_Goes with him towards door_.]  I have told Farquhar to put a brace of partridge into the carriage.  Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them.
[_Exit_.] 
[_Outside_.]   Let me go!  Let me go!  [_Enter_ HESTER _in terror_, _and rushes over to_ GERALD _and flings herself in his arms_.]
[_Rising_.]   Good morning, Lady Hunstanton.  Good morning, Mrs. Allonby.
[_Rising_.]   A bad headache!  I am so sorry!  Perhaps you’ll bring her up to Hunstanton this afternoon, if she is better, Gerald.
[_Exeunt_.] 
[1]  A more recent performance of "Salomé" (1906), by the Literary Theatre Club, has again produced an ebullition of rancour and deliberate misrepresentation on the part of the dramatic critics, the majority of whom are anxious to parade their ignorance of the continental stage. The production was remarkable on account of the beautiful dresses and mounting, for which Mr. Charles Ricketts was responsible, and the marvellous impersonation of Herod by Mr. Robert Farquharson. Wilde used to say that "Salomé" was a mirror in which everyone could see himself. The artist, art; the dull, dulness; the vulgar, vulgarity.
[Illustration] 
[_Smiling_.] 
[_Rising._]  Will you indeed give me whatsoever I shall ask, Tetrarch?
[Laughing.]
